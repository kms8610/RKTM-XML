  <VCE_TilledSoil.description>Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, increasing terrain fertility. Tilling soil can only be done on normal soil (not rich soil). When a plant is harvested on a plowed soil, the floor becomes a normal soil again and needs to be plowed again manually.</VCE_TilledSoil.description>
