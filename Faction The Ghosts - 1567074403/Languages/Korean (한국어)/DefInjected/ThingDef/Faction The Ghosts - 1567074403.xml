  <RNApparel_511TacTec_Ghost.description>The 5.11 company introduces TACTEC Plate Carrier. Initially marketed as weight vests to crossfitters, 5.11 found a way to sell the TacTec plate carriers to people who won't spend a moment in combat by convincing them that it's better to buy this plate carrier which costs hundreds of dollars (That's without the ballistic plates, by the way.) than to wear something else with weight.
	
Operators in the field who can't afford Crye Precision gear choose this alternative due to it's ergonomic and lightweight capabilities. The extra weight from the operator's wallet disappeared thanks to 5.11.</RNApparel_511TacTec_Ghost.description>
