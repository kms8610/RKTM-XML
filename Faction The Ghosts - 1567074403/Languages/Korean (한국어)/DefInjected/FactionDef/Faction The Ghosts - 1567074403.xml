  <RH_TheGhosts.description>The Ghosts, officially known as Task Force: STALKER. Composed of soldiers from Tier One Special Forces teams, not officially tied to any country, government or organization.

It's unknown what brings this group here in this Rim planet of all places, without a given reason or story. According to civil outlanders, the Ghosts are looking for militias or other communities willing to bear arms. These masked individuals with their distinctive uniforms are oddly enough, offering cheap supplies to friendlies in order to give them a "fighting chance".
	
Even when heavily outnumbered, they stay and defend with their lives. Under dead bodies of fallen comrades in the dark with nothing but blades or fists when the ammo runs out. That's how they earned their name "Ghosts".</RH_TheGhosts.description>
