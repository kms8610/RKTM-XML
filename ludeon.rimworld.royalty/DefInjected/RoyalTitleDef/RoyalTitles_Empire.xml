  <Acolyte.label>acolyte</Acolyte.label>
  <Acolyte.description>The title of acolyte is the first title of noble duty, and encompasses a wide range of practical positions. Some acolytes are purely students, learning to lead troops, manage societies, or use psycasts in specialized schools. Others come from wealthy families and might own city buildings or farm complexes.\n\nDuring wartime, an acolyte might lead a platoon of troops, captain a small frigate, or serve their lord as an advisor.\n\nTheir low rank within the nobility makes them paradoxically less useful as diplomats than yeomen. Sending a low-ranked acolyte to a negotiation can itself be seen as an insult, whereas a non-noble yeoman negotiator is seen only as the mouthpiece of his lord.</Acolyte.description>
  
  <Baron.label>baron</Baron.label>
  <Baron.description>The title of baron is the lowest of the middle nobility. While lower titles focus on personal service at war or commerce under a lord, barons hold title as semi-independent rulers. Each baron is subordinate to his liege lord, but his obligations are mostly in supplying wealth and troops, and not in personal service.\n\nIn the Empire, a baron will typically own a city sector, mining colony, or similar outfit. At wartime, a baron may captain a capital ship in name, or control a regiment of troops.</Baron.description>

  <Emperor.description>The Imperial title of emperor indicates sovereign dominion over the entire Empire, all its peoples, planets, and fleets.

  <Knight.label>knight</Knight.label>
  <Knight.description>The title of knight is held by nobles who have largely passed their training, but who have not ascended to higher leadership roles.

  <Stellarch.label>stellarch</Stellarch.label>
  <Stellarch.description>The Imperial title of stellarch represents dominion over an entire star system.\n\nIn the Empire, since interstellar travel times are years long, stellarchs rule their systems with a great degree of independence. They each swear fealty to the Emperor, but since the Emperor may be many light-years away, a stellarch may go years or decades without interacting with him.</Stellarch.description>
  
  <Yeoman.label>yeoman</Yeoman.label>
  <Yeoman.description>The Imperial title of yeoman is held by those who serve a noble lord in an important, specific way. While it is not a noble title, it does give the holder the right to use low-level psychic abilities.\n\nThis title is often held by senior soldiers, warskiff pilots, spies, advisors, diplomats, intrusion operatives, and other key individuals. Many important people spend their entire lives as yeomen, seeking success outside the strictures of nobility.</Yeoman.description>
