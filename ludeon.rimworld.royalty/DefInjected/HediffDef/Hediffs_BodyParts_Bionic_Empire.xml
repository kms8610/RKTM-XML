  <ArmorskinGland.label>armorskin gland</ArmorskinGland.label>
  <ArmorskinGland.description>An installed armorskin gland. Releases chemicals and nanomachines that toughen the skin and add flexible subdermal keratin plates at strategic points. This makes the user more resistant to damage across their whole body. Unfortunately, these changes make the skin appear leathery, with wrinkles across the whole body and face, which is generally considered ugly.</ArmorskinGland.description>
  <ArmorskinGland.labelNoun>a armorskin gland</ArmorskinGland.labelNoun>
  
  <CircadianAssistant.label>circadian assistant</CircadianAssistant.label>
  <CircadianAssistant.description>An installed circadian assistant. Produces chemicals and nanomachines that clear toxin buildup from the brain.</CircadianAssistant.description>
  <CircadianAssistant.labelNoun>a circadian assistant</CircadianAssistant.labelNoun>
  
  <CircadianHalfCycler.label>circadian half-cycler</CircadianHalfCycler.label>
  <CircadianHalfCycler.description>An installed circadian half-cycler. Isolates half of the brain, allowing the other half to sleep while the user remains outwardly awake. By alternating brain halves, the user never needs to sleep. Unfortunately, two hemispheres are better than one - working with half a brain causes a reduction in consciousness.</CircadianHalfCycler.description>
  <CircadianHalfCycler.labelNoun>a circadian half-cycler</CircadianHalfCycler.labelNoun>
  
  <Coagulator.label>coagulator</Coagulator.label>

  <DetoxifierStomach.label>sterilizing stomach</DetoxifierStomach.label>
  <DetoxifierStomach.description>An installed sterilizing stomach. Allows the user to eat almost anything without ever worrying about food poisoning.</DetoxifierStomach.description>
  <DetoxifierStomach.labelNoun>a sterilizing stomach</DetoxifierStomach.labelNoun>
  
  <GastroAnalyzer.label>gastro-analyzer</GastroAnalyzer.label>
  <GastroAnalyzer.description>An installed gastro-analyzer. Enhances the sense of smell, with a focus towards food-related smells. A multi-layered ultrafine absorption mesh detects compounds in the air. A microprocessor formats the readings into an olfactory nerve signal to send to the brain through a nerve-link interface. The result is that the user can smell foods with a depth, richness, and precision unknown among unenhanced humans, allowing them to cook more effectively. The whole unit is small enough to be installed in the nose without affecting the user's appearance.</GastroAnalyzer.description>
  <GastroAnalyzer.labelNoun>a gastro-analyzer</GastroAnalyzer.labelNoun>
  
  <HealingEnhancer.label>healing enhancer</HealingEnhancer.label>
  <HealingEnhancer.description>An installed healing enhancer implant. Releases nanomachines and healing factors that speed up wound healing. This implant only helps with physical wounds, and does nothing to combat disease or other health problems.</HealingEnhancer.description>
  <HealingEnhancer.labelNoun>a healing enhancer</HealingEnhancer.labelNoun>
  
  <Immunoenhancer.label>immunoenhancer</Immunoenhancer.label>
  <Immunoenhancer.description>An installed immunoenhancer. An analysis computer which inspects the bloodstream, classifies pathogens, and rapidly prompts the body's natural immune system to respond to them faster than it could alone. This speeds immunity gain significantly.</Immunoenhancer.description>
  <Immunoenhancer.labelNoun>an immunoenhancer</Immunoenhancer.labelNoun>
  
  <LearningAssistant.label>learning assistant</LearningAssistant.label>
  <LearningAssistant.description>An installed learning assistant. A sensory recording system that replays important experiences during sleep, strengthening the formation of new memories.</LearningAssistant.description>

  <Neurocalculator.description>An installed neurocalculator. A non-intelligent microcomputer controlled by a visual/tactile neural interface. It assists with memory and calculation, like a calculator and notepad embedded in the brain.</Neurocalculator.description>
  <Neurocalculator.labelNoun>a neurocalculator</Neurocalculator.labelNoun>
  
  <NuclearStomach.label>nuclear stomach</NuclearStomach.label>
  <NuclearStomach.description>An installed nuclear stomach. A micro-nuclear reactor combined with complex chemical synthesis replaces the body's need for food energy. Food is required only to replace matter lost from the body, reducing the user's intake needs significantly. This artificial stomach cannot get food poisoning. However, there is little room to shield the reactor, so the radiation increases the risk of cancer.</NuclearStomach.description>
  <NuclearStomach.labelNoun>a nuclear stomach</NuclearStomach.labelNoun>
  
  <ReprocessorStomach.label>reprocessor stomach</ReprocessorStomach.label>
  <ReprocessorStomach.description>An installed reprocessor stomach. Includes an advanced chemical processing system breaks down nutrients the body could normally never use, leading to increased efficiency.</ReprocessorStomach.description>
  <ReprocessorStomach.labelNoun>a reprocessor stomach</ReprocessorStomach.labelNoun>
  
  <StoneskinGland.label>stoneskin gland</StoneskinGland.label>
  <StoneskinGland.description>An installed stoneskin gland. Releases chemical and nanomachines that transform the user's skin into a built-in suit of armor. The whole epidermis thickens and hardens to resist burns, while jointed exterior keratin plates form everywhere they can - including the head and face. While it's very difficult to physically hurt someone using this implant, the plates and hard skin significantly reduces the user's physical attractiveness.</StoneskinGland.description>
  <StoneskinGland.labelNoun>a stoneskin gland</StoneskinGland.labelNoun>
  
  <ToughskinGland.label>toughskin gland</ToughskinGland.label>
  <ToughskinGland.description>An installed toughskin gland. Releases chemicals and nanomachines that toughen the skin, making it somewhat more resistant to damage. While it doesn't add as much protection as some other skin-hardening glands, the toughskin gland has the advantage of not noticeably altering the user's appearance.</ToughskinGland.description>
