    <li>questDescription->[asker_nameFull], a [asker_royalTitleInCurrentFaction] of [asker_faction_name] is calling from nearby. [asker_possessive] guards were killed in an ambush. [asker_pronoun] escaped, but is now being followed by (*Threat)a manhunting [animalKindDef_label](/Threat).\n\n[asker_nameDef] wants you to keep [asker_objective] safe at [map_definite] for a few hours until [asker_possessive] shuttle can come pick [asker_objective] up.\n\n[asker_pronoun] will bestow [royalFavorReward] [asker_faction_royalFavorLabel] on whoever accepts this quest. This is enough [asker_faction_royalFavorLabel] to receive the royal title of Yeoman, and all benefits that come with it - including the first level of psychic powers.</li>
