  <DevBuildWarning>Warning: This is an unstable development build. This means we are running design experiments and doing technical development.\n\nSome things will be temporarily unbalanced on purpose. This is a classic game design method where we deliberately go too far with a balance change in order to better understand balance boundaries. We can then use that information to decide on the final balance points.\n\nThere will also be bugs, including game-breaking ones. Save compatibility may break any time.\n\nIf you're okay with all of this, thanks for testing! If you don't want to be subject to our experiments, please play the latest stable version.</DevBuildWarning>

It's the way RimWorld was designed to be played.\n\nThere's a reason Luke Skywalker didn't quit and reload when his family got killed - loss and recovery is dramatic.</PermadeathModeInfo>

  <TechprintLabel>techprint ({PROJECT_label})</TechprintLabel>
  <TechprintDesc>This is a techprint for the research project '{PROJECT_label}'.
\nThe physical form of techprints can range from scraps of paper with diagrams, all the way to advanced self-contained teaching machines. Regardless of form, they play the same role. They give your researchers the confidence that an idea is possible, and a rough idea of the designs used in more established societies.
\nYour researchers need the foundational knowledge offered by techprints to know where to start on a given technology. Only after enough techprints have been applied can your researchers work out the fine details of how to make use of the technology in your particular situation.
\nApplying techprints to a satisfied project fulfills half the remaining research progress. In addition, researchers always gain a boost to their intellectual skills when applying techprints, even on already-completed technologies.</TechprintDesc>
