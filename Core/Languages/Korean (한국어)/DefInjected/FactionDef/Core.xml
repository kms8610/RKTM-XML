  <Mechanoid.label>mechanoid hive</Mechanoid.label>
  <Mechanoid.description>Killer machines of unknown origin. Hidden in ancient structures, under mounds of dust, or at the bottom of the ocean, mechanoids can self-maintain for thousands of years. This group of mechs seems to be unified in purpose, but not well-coordinated in action. While local scholars believe they're autonomous weapons left over from an ancient war, tribal legends describe them as the demonic servants of a sleeping god.</Mechanoid.description>

  <Insect.label>insect geneline</Insect.label>
  <Insect.description>These giant insect-like creatures live underground and burrow up to attack when attracted by noise or pheromone signals. Originally from the planet Sorne, interstellar entrepreneurs managed to capture, genetically-modify, and vat-grow the insect colonies for use as weapons. It's not clear who placed Sorne insects on this planet, but they are here and as dangerous as ever.</Insect.description>

  <TribeCivil.label>gentle tribe</TribeCivil.label>
  <TribeCivil.description>These people have been here a very long time. Maybe their ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago. Maybe they survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization here. In any case, the tribals are mostly nomadic people who live off the land using primitive tools and weapons.\n\nDespite their apparent technological weakness, the tribals can be dangerous enemies and valuable friends because of their skill with low-tech warfare, their numbers, and their hardiness.\n\nThis particular tribe pursues a gentle way of life where they can. They are quite open to trade and alliances, even with strange peoples.</TribeCivil.description>

  <Pirate.label>pirate gang</Pirate.label>
  <Pirate.description>A loose confederation of pirate gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nPirates don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.\n\nTheir technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range.</Pirate.description>
