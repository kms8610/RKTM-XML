  <FirePreparation.label>Fire preparation</FirePreparation.label>
  <FirePreparation.helpText>Fires can easily burn down a colony. To defeat them, you must prepare before they happen.
\nThese design elements can help reduce the damage from fires:
\n1. Instead of constructing one super-building, build separate buildings with spaces in between.
\n2. Use less flammable materials. Wood is cheap and fast - but very flammable.
\n3. Build firebreaks to stop wildfires approaching your base. A strip of concrete floor 3 or 4 cells wide will generally stop an advancing fire.</FirePreparation.helpText>

The shooter will fire over his friend's shoulder.\n\nThis is a good way to combine ranged and melee fighters.</FriendlyFireSafety.helpText>
  <TradeGoodsMustBeNearBeacon.label>Trade goods and trade beacons</TradeGoodsMustBeNearBeacon.label>
