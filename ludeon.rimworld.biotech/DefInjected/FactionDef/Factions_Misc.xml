  <OutlanderRoughPig.label>rough pig union</OutlanderRoughPig.label>
  <OutlanderRoughPig.description>A loose union of hardy pigskin townships. They're willing to make friends, even with thinsnouts, but they're also ready to toss a bomb and gnaw human gristle when it suits them. Treat them with respect and they'll offer a trotter to an ally in need. Turn against them and the last thing you hear might be a triumphant battle squeal.</OutlanderRoughPig.description>

  <PirateWaster.label>waster pirates</PirateWaster.label>
  <PirateWaster.description>A loose collection of violent pirate bands made up primarily of wasters - xenohumans engineered to thrive around toxins and pollution. They have little interest in building, or farming, preferring to take their sustenance from others using violence.\n\nTheir technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range.</PirateWaster.description>

  <TribeRoughNeanderthal.label>fierce neanderthal tribe</TribeRoughNeanderthal.label>
  <TribeRoughNeanderthal.description>An unfriendly, territorial tribe of neanderthals. They are open to peaceful trade, but are otherwise unfriendly and territorial. Warriors from their tribe won't hesitate to bash in the skulls of anyone they deem dangerous. Their numbers, and the extreme amounts of damage they absorb before falling make them serious foes despite their lack of technology and analytical ability.\n\nHaving been on this planet for countless generations, they have no memory of how they got here. They might be the descendants of a neanderthal service caste from a dead civilization, or even the leftovers from some ancient science experiment.</TribeRoughNeanderthal.description>

  <TribeSavageImpid.label>savage impid tribe</TribeSavageImpid.label>
  <TribeSavageImpid.description>A vicious tribe of yellow-skinned, fire-spewing impids. This particular tribe has no intention of coexisting peacefully with anyone else. Their warriors are experts at using their natural speed and flame attacks to burn the towns and children of other peoples.\n\nHaving been here for thousands of years, the origins of this tribe are lost in myth. They might descend from a group of settlers who lost their technology, or an impid community in some long-ruined civilization.</TribeSavageImpid.description>
