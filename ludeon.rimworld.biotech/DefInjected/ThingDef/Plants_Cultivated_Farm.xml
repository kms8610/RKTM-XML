  <Plant_Toxipotato.description>A genetically-engineered variant of potato adapted for growing in polluted areas. Compared to regular potatoes, toxipotatoes take less time to grow but yield a meager harvest of food. When eaten raw, they have a high chance of causing food poisoning. In spite of this, they have saved many settlers from starvation after toxic events.</Plant_Toxipotato.description>
