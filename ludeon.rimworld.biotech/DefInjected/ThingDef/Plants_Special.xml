  <Plant_TreePolux.description>After generations of exposure, these trees have evolved to metabolize pollutants.

However, they cannot do this if buildings are constructed over their roots.\n\nUnlike most methods of cleaning polluted terrain, polux trees do not create toxic wastepacks.</Plant_TreePolux.description>
