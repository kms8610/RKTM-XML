  <RH_UAC.description>The Union Aerospace Corporation is a multi-planetary conglomerate that operates facilities across multiple planets and moons.\n\nAccording to their company website, they have expanded to the outer rimworlds for research purposes, offering job opportunities for those who live within these worlds in an attempt to reduce crime rate and help build communities while at the same time contributing to the advancement of mankind. The UAC is well known for their innovations in clothing, firearms, medicine and space travel. \n\nAmong the outlander community, are conspiracy theorists that believe that the UAC aren't the angels they present themselves to be. There are cover ups regarding unethical practice, treatment of animals, prisoners, theft of artifacts, workplace "accidents" and non-regulated human trials. All these allegations have been denied by UAC representatives and are said to be nothing more than "misguided fanaticism".\n\nWith the UAC outsourcing, their staff roster is mostly made up of people from the home world their operations are in, most of which have never met their bosses in person despite rising through the ranks.</RH_UAC.description>
