  <VFEI_MercenarySquad.scenario.description>A simple mission down to the surface of a long forgotten planet went south. Your base has been overrun by creatures you have not seen before - giant insectoids, emerging in infinite numbers from their hives. Forced to escape, you approach a small outpost crawling with the insectoids that sent you on the run in the first place.\nYou can exterminate them and settle here, or leave and find a new place to start anew.\nNote: Since you start with no resources and the base overrun by insectoids, this is an especially difficult scenario in the early game.</VFEI_MercenarySquad.scenario.description>
