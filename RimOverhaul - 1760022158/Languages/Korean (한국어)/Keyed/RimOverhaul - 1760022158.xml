  <ClimateBombDesc>We've discovered the location of an armed climate bomb. Who built it and why it was left on this planet is not clear, but we need to neutralize it. If we don't and allow it to detonate, the next few seasons will be very chaotic. \n\nWe need to assemble a strong combat force, there will likely be enemies defending it.

  <Comm_ShipCrashTitle>Ship crash</Comm_ShipCrashTitle>
  <Comm_ShipCrashDesc>A space ship was spotted breaking apart in atmosphere. It appears to be general purpose traveler's ship. Segments of the ship separate and diverge onto their own crash courses, likely cargo and living compartments of various sizes. \nThe ship's parts have scattered all over the planet. Ship plating is often constructed with plasteel and may have left some of the contents intact. You can travel to the crash sites and attempt to salvage what you can, but many others will have also seen the crash and will surely want to claim some of it for themselves.</Comm_ShipCrashDesc>

  <PlanetDestroyed>At once everyone covers their ears in pain. It is as if a million lightning bolts struck in the same place at once - a small artificial star is born just beyond the world's atmosphere. Everyone stumbles as the planet begins to move, plunging into blinding orb of light. As the last remnants of hope shatter, so too does the planet's surface, cracks of the world's molten blood erupt and spread across the surface like crimson rivers.
The apocalyptic machine emits a column of bright light, a leash leading the planet to its grave. The atmosphere ignites in a cleansing flame that provides a quick death, perhaps quicker than is truly deserved. The fragments of this broken world will be an everlasting monument to the folly of man. While most others in the universe will see it as a lesson, some may see it as potential.

It seems the boss is still going to use the weapon for blackmail.
Hell, he's gonna blow this world up.
Of course I'm not against scoring heap of silver, but I also live here! I tried to persuade him to be rational, but his greed is driving him crazy.
I want to play it safe if in case things get out of hand, but I can't just write out the password here and risk someone else finding this letter.
The password is the answer to this riddle, one I've told you many times, you should have no problems solving it.
"You enter a dark kitchen with no power. There is a candle, a kerosene lamp, and a gas stove. What will you light first?"
One word. Use it to log in as Feral.
