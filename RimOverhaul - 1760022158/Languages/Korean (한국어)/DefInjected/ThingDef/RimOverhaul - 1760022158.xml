  <MineableIron.label>Iron ore</MineableIron.label>
  <MineableIron.description>It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.

Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.</MineableIron.description>
  <MineableCopper.label>Copper ore</MineableCopper.label>
  <MineableCopper.description>A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.</MineableCopper.description>

The presence of an advanced computer communication system allows you to immediately make a destructive attack for all living things, while in space or on another planet.

Having got into the wrong hands, the Doomsday weapon will bring many troubles related to oxygen starvation, solar radiation, numerous mutations and many other extremely remarkable events.</DoomsdayUltimateBomb.description>

  <IronOre.description>It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.

Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.
