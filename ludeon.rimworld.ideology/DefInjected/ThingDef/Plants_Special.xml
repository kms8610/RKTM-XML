  <Plant_TreeGauranlen.description>A large, distinctive-looking tree with a unique life-cycle. Each Gauranlen tree contains a small non-conscious dryad queen. The queen births creatures called dryads which guard and tend the tree. In exchange, the tree nurtures its protectors by feeding them directly. From the outside, it appears the dryads are created by the tree directly and act as part of it.\n\nIt is possible for a person to form a connection with a Gauranlen tree and partially control the dryads it produces.\n\nSome say Gauranlen trees are the homes of nature spirits that follow humanity across worlds.</Plant_TreeGauranlen.description>
