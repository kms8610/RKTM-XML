  <TM_Entertain.description>Entertain fellow colonists using a variety of methods. This skill has two components, a passive skill and an active skill. The passive skill allows the bard to entertain other colonists in passing conversation.

This command toggles the active skill on or off.
	
Activating the ability casts a net over the colony and allows the bard to detect troubled pawns and attempt to entertain them. The bard will gain experience points as a mage when active entertaining is successful. Keeping this ability active reduces max mana by 30. The bard performs entertainment as a type of job, and will perform entertainment based on the priority of the "Warden" work type.</TM_Entertain.description>

  <TM_BloodGift.label>Blood Sacrifice</TM_BloodGift.label>
  <TM_BloodGift.description>Combines blood and mana into a hybrid form of power used to perform blood magic. The use of blood sacrifice inflicts several deep cuts to allow ready access to blood and combines it with mana to generate an immediate amount of blood magic power.
	
Blood mages can slowly generate blood magic power from open, bleeding wounds without the use of mana, and can also train to use fresh, exposed blood near them to fuel blood magic.

A blood mage will slowly lose blood magic power when they are no longer bleeding.</TM_BloodGift.description>

  <TM_BloodForBlood.label>Blood For Blood</TM_BloodForBlood.label>
  <TM_BloodForBlood.description>Curses a targets blood to heat and accelerate until it seeps from every pore of its victim. This curse has several affects. 

The blood that's expelled from the target becomes a mist that the caster absorbs as restorative energy and uses it to mend wounds and replenish blood reserves. This ability will slowly heal scars and other permanent injuries of the caster.

The wounds and injuries of a target will also be healed as the blood exits their body. The target loses a portion of their blood each pulse and, like any wound, can result in incapacitation or death if they lose too much blood.

The transfer and healing rate is increased for both caster and victim depending on how much the victim is bleeding. The effects are the same when used on friendly or enemy pawns, but will trigger an outrage if used to down or slay an allied or neutral pawn.</TM_BloodForBlood.description>
  <TM_BloodShield.label>Blood Shield</TM_BloodShield.label>
  <TM_BloodShield.description>Surrounds a target in a barrier formed from the blood energy of the caster. The energy from the shield will slowly regenerate the pawn it is protecting. Any damage done to the shield disperses some of this energy but also causes a burst of healing on the protected pawn.
		
A portion of damage absorbed by the shield will be inflicted on the caster due to the blood link - this includes the gradual healing. As long as the blood mage supporting the shield has blood magic power, any returned damage will detract from this blood power, but if the blood mage is out of blood magic power, returned damage will cause physical harm to the blood mage.
		
Blood mages cannot form a blood shield on themselves.</TM_BloodShield.description>

  <TM_Prediction.label>Prediction</TM_Prediction.label>
  <TM_Prediction.description>Enables Prediction - a conscious effort dedicated to deciphering future events. Prediction has two components.
	
The first component is a self-awareness and intuition that makes the chronomancer uncannily difficult to harm, however, this splits the attention of the chronomancer and reduces their physical acuity and speed.

The second component focuses on the prediction of significant events. Indicators such as flight of birds, a cloud of dust, a sound in the wind are highlighted to the chronomancer and woven together into a tapestry depicting a possible future.

Neither method is infallible, but practice can improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce the focus required to sustain it.

This ability reduces mana regeneration by 50%.</TM_Prediction.description>

  <TM_AlterFate.description>Alter the flow of time to avoid predicted disasters. This ability relies on accurate Predictions to shape the future. Highly skilled chronomancers can revert environmental conditions even after they occur.
	
Alter Fate is most effective against environmental conditions. This ability can backfire, however, causing the event to change, become more severe, or trigger the infamous "butterfly effect."</TM_AlterFate.description>
  <TM_AccelerateTime.label>Accelerate Time</TM_AccelerateTime.label>
  <TM_AccelerateTime.description>Accelerate Time applies a field around the target where all physical matter rapidly ages.

When applied to inanimate objects, the effect is instant and will deteriorate items significantly; this can cause an item to disassemble into its base components. There is no area of effect for this function, only the object at the center will be affected.

Living tissue will resist instant change, and requires a more gradual approach. Any living pawn affected will have increased movement and manipulation speed. Neutral elements (plants) will experience rapid growth.

When use at a location or on a hostile enemy, all enemies in the area will be cursed with rapid aging. This will drain rest and energy from the target, accelerate other health conditions, and may inflict age related ailments.

When used on friendly pawns, there is no area of effect, only the primary target will be affected. The aging process for friendly pawns is much more gradual, and may be canceled by Reverse Time.</TM_AccelerateTime.description>
  <TM_ReverseTime.label>Reverse Time</TM_ReverseTime.label>
  <TM_ReverseTime.description>Reverse Time applies a field around the target where all physical matter reverses its natural decay. Reversing the effects of time is more difficult - it requires more energy than accelerating time and can only be applied to a single target at a time.

When applied to inanimate objects, the effect is instant and will regenerate items and restore material to a previous state. Reverse Time can be used to restore rotting food, decaying equipment, and tainted material.

Living tissue will resist instant change and requires a more gradual approach. Any living pawn affected will have decreased movement and manipulation speed and their biological aging will reverse. This can remove many ailments that were caused recently as the tissue is restored to a state prior to the ailment; this includes wounds, diseases, and age related ailments that occurred within the window of time reversal.

Reverse Time can be dispelled by countering the effects with Accelerate Time.</TM_ReverseTime.description>

  <TM_TimeMark.label>Time Mark</TM_TimeMark.label>
  <TM_TimeMark.description>The chronomancer is able to capture their status at a specific point in time and return themselves to that point. This ability does not change time or affect anything else besides the chronomancer. The chronomancer will retain any memories they have at the time recall is activated; automated activation from a killing blow can inflict mental breaks since the chronomancer will remember their death.

Recall has a limited effective span (~1 day) before the time marker expires and must be re-applied. When the time marker is active, max MP is reduced by 40 mana and mana regeneration is decreased by 30%.

When set to autocast, the chronomancer will attempt to maintain a recall marker at all times - this does not affect activation triggers (downed/dead) which will always trigger if the skill is learned and time is marked.

To maintain physical cohesion during a recall, the caster will retain all conditions with permanence (missing or added body parts, permanent injuries).  All chronomancer spells are reset following a Recall except Recall itself.</TM_TimeMark.description>

  <TM_Polymorph_III.description>Transforms pawns in the target area into random beasts. The polymorphed creature will still retain enough of its original self to recognize, and be enraged by, its predicament. Allies can be controlled (drafted), but will still exhibit 'animal' behavior without a specific task.
		
Allies may be polymorphed, but most will be upset by the altercation. Enchanters cannot use this method to polymorph themselves.

Use of polymorph on a creature already affected by polymorph will end the existing polymorph enchantment. The polymorph enchantment is broken if the polymorph creature dies.

When a target is polymorphed, their new form does not retain any pre-existing injuries, however, when they return to their original form they will have all their original injuries in addition to any injuries sustained while polymorphed.

  <TM_Shapeshift.label>Shapeshift</TM_Shapeshift.label>
  <TM_Shapeshift.description>Shapeshift into a random creature. The enchanter will retain their sense of self and will retain control of their actions. Damage suffered while shape shifted will be transferred in equal proportions to the enchanter after returning to their original form.
	
Shapeshifting is not without minor side effects; shapeshifting into an animal will cause the enchanter to inherit instincts and behavior of the animal, if they haven't been given specific instructions, they will wander or do other random tasks an animal would normally do.</TM_Shapeshift.description>
  <TM_ShapeshiftDW.label>Shapeshift: Dire Wolf</TM_ShapeshiftDW.label>
  <TM_ShapeshiftDW.description>Shapeshift into a dire wolf. The enchanter will retain their sense of self and remain in control of most of their actions. Damage suffered while shape shifted will be transferred in equal proportions to the enchanter after returning to their original form.
	
Shapeshifting is not without minor side effects; shapeshifting into an animal will cause the enchanter to inherit instincts and behavior of the animal, if they haven't been given specific instructions, they will wander or do other random tasks an animal would normally do.
	
Dire wolves are unique animals with a special connection to magic. While in dire wolf form, enchanters can exert small quantities of magic to allow the dire wolf to briefly phase in and out of reality.</TM_ShapeshiftDW.description>
  <TM_Disguise.label>Deception</TM_Disguise.label>
  <TM_Disguise.description>The faceless manipulates light and motion to make their form appear meaningless to any observer; on a subconscious level, any observer will cognitively dismiss the faceless as an unimportant, harmless object, essentially making the faceless invisible.
	
Disguise will not fool any pawn that already sees the faceless as a threat.</TM_Disguise.description>

  <TM_Possess.label>Possess</TM_Possess.label>
  <TM_Possess.description>Like a puppet master, the faceless applies of the mind and body to cause extreme self-doubt on a target pawn - allowing them to control their target through mental suggestion and coercion. 
		
Nearby enemies are unlikely to immediately detect the possession unless they see suspicious activity. If detected, neutral and friendly factions will consider aggressive actions from a possessed pawn as an act of hostility.

Only creatures with a human-like mind capable of self-doubt can be possessed.</TM_Possess.description>
  <TM_MedicalSupply.label>Resupply</TM_MedicalSupply.label>
  <TM_MedicalSupply.description>Resupply the Field Medic's medical supplies.

  <TM_Stoneskin.label>Stoneskin</TM_Stoneskin.label>
  <TM_Stoneskin.description>Applies stoneskin to the target pawn. Each charge of stoneskin absorbs a single attack, regardless of how powerful, or weak, the attack is. Stoneskin is an unsubstantial defense, meaning the defensive measures it employs are not physical and will not interfere with the combat capabilities of its ward.
		
Stoneskin requires a constant reserve of mana to maintain, each application will reduce the casters maximum mana by 15. The caster can only maintain a limited number of stoneskin instances regardless of how much mana the caster has available.

Applying stoneskin to a target that already has stoneskin will remove all charges of stoneskin on the target and dissipate the spell (returning mana reserves back to the caster).</TM_Stoneskin.description>

  <TM_EarthSprites.label>Earth Sprites</TM_EarthSprites.label>
  <TM_EarthSprites.description>Calls forth earth sprites to transform the terrain. Sprites appear as flecks of light and can easily be missed by the inattentive, but they are diligent workers capable of breaking rock or stone down into its base component or increase the richness and fertility of soil. 
		
Once summoned, they will continue to work on the terrain, even moving to nearby area's, until dismissed by the geomancer. Earth sprites only understand basic instructions and will move randomly to a new area to continue their work; if no nearby area needs work, the summoning will end. If earth sprites are summoned into an area named "earth sprites" then they will only move to nearby cells within this area.

In exchange for their efforts, earth sprites expect a steady and substantial supply of mana. If the geomancer fails to meet this request, the earth sprites will fade away. Each geomancer can only request the help of a single earth sprite, regardless of how much mana they have.</TM_EarthSprites.description>

  <TM_EarthernHammer.description>The geomancer manipulates the laws of gravity to catapult massive stones from the surrounding earth. The amount of gravitational energy reversed is finite; nearby surface stones require minimal energy while subterranean stones require significantly more.
		
The first, and every third stone after, will always be subterranean unless there is insufficient gravitational energy in which case the geomancer will attempt to use the remaining energy throwing nearby stones. The extreme shift in gravity will temporarily disorient the geomancer.</TM_EarthernHammer.description>
  <TM_Sentinel.label>Sentinel</TM_Sentinel.label>

There is no limit to the number of undead a necromancer may control, however, when the necromancer no longer has mana to maintain undead, they will automatically be consumed until the number of active undead is reduced to a manageable amount.</TM_RaiseUndead.description>

  <TM_AnimalFriend.label>Animal Bond</TM_AnimalFriend.label>
  <TM_AnimalFriend.description>At home in the wild, the ranger is able to form a bond with creatures of the wild. 
		
Rangers are only able to form a single bond and maintaining the bond reduces the ranger's max stamina by 30; making a new bond breaks an existing bond and will cause the animal with a broken bond to leave forever. Failed attempts may cause the animal to turn manhunter. When using animal bond on the bonded animal may allow the animal to remain in the colony - the chance the animal remains is based on its wildness and how long it had a bond with the ranger.

The increase in physical capability applies to the animal kin only, in return, the bonded animal will assist the ranger in whatever capacity the animal is capable.
A bond can be removed by using this ability on a bonded creature.</TM_AnimalFriend.description>
