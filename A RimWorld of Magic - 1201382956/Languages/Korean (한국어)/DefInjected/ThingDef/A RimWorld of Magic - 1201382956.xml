It's not clear how they float, though one can only assume it has something to do with the hot, putrid stench that follows them everywhere.
Their usefulness is open for debate; they possess little in terms of combat ability and would sooner flee than fight.  They -can- do simple tasks such as hauling and cleaning (though they seem to have a different definition of "clean").  However, it seems more likely to find them lounging near the television or smoking a joint (or both) than doing anything productive.
They can be summoned by gullible... er, trained mages, and, in return for giving them a break from their "pit fiend of a boss," they are willing to "help out" around the place.
Occasionally, they express the desire to hit things and can (usually) be convinced to hit some nearby rocks.
If things get too tough for them or they get bored, they'll flee back to wherever they came.</TM_MinionR.description>

  <TableArcaneForge.description>The arcane forge allows a mage to wield raw arcane power to create material objects. 
	
Scientifically, the arcane forge might be described as a matter fabricator, though the exact mechanics have yet to be determined.  Only those possessing the ability to manipulate arcane power are able to use the arcane forge.

Using the arcane forge dramatically increases crafting speed but consumes mana.  Items of quality are determined by the mage's intelligence skill and class level.</TableArcaneForge.description>
  <TableMagicCircle.label>magic circle</TableMagicCircle.label>
  <TableMagicCircle.description>The magic circle is a construct that amplifies magic by aligning the physical and arcane into a focal point. While it may seem simple, the circle is outlined with elaborate runes and constructed with detailed precision.

Mages can use the magic circle to augment their power or combine their energy with other mages to create unique, powerful effects. The circle may accomodate up to six mages.

The type of material used in construction directly affects the quality of the magic circle.
Stone (any): no bonuses
Steel: no bonus
Wood: no bonus
Jade: success chance +30%
Silver: refunds 25% of material cost
Plasteel: event points +15%, duration +10%

  <TM_TechnoTurret_Base.description>The Mark-IV is a deployable turret that provides the firepower of a heavy weapon system. It uses miniaturization to allow the user to easily transport the system when not in use. The key component of the Mark-IV is the matter converter that uses raw energy to repair and resupply the turret when in a miniaturized state, allowing a nominal energy to matter conversion. However, even using plasteel and hyperweave to strengthen the weapon system, the material was simply unable to withstand the pressure placed on it during the conversion process and was high susceptible to breakdown and component failure.
	
Technomancers have since adapted the system and use their control over arcane energy to provide the turret with ammunition while deployed and energy for repairs and the miniaturization process.

Due to its weight, the Mark-IV cannot be moved while deployed.</TM_TechnoTurret_Base.description>

  <RawMagicyte.label>unrefined magicyte</RawMagicyte.label>
  <RawMagicyte.description>A stone that seems to wrap itself in a dull, glassy surface, as if a mysterious power has cloaked itself in the center of the stone. Seemingly composed of the same stone it was cut from, this fairly unremarkable stone shimmers slightly, even in the dark, and it emits an energy signature that mages can detect when touching the stone.
	
Raw Magicyte can be refined to make a variety of enchanting gems at the gemcutting table.</RawMagicyte.description>
  <TM_Manaweave.label>manaweave</TM_Manaweave.label>
  <TM_Manaweave.description>Manaweave is cloth that has been fused with magicyte and meticulously imbued with arcane symbols. Manaweave inherits many of the physical properties of cloth, but acquires an additional reactive response to physical force. What makes the fabric unique is its ability to act as a conductor of mana that enhances the effects of enchantments and naturally grants protection against light and dark magic. 

Extremely difficult and taxing to create, only a talented and knowledgeable mage can make this material.</TM_Manaweave.description>
  <TM_Arcalleum.label>arcalleum</TM_Arcalleum.label>
  <TM_Arcalleum.description>A metal alloy consisting of steel, jade, silver and magicyte. Its unique composition gives it mystical properties that increased elasticity and creates reverberations of any magical energy transferred through it. The elasticity of the alloy makes it an excellent choice for blunt protection, but is sub-standard for use in bladed weapons. Arcalleum is difficult to create and requires a forge capable of liquefying and combining all ingredients of the alloy.
	
	While arcalluem is sought after for its enhanced defensive properties, it is also prized by fighters and mages alike for its power to nullify the cooldown of any ability. Each kg of arcalleum worn increases the chance an ability cooldown is nullified after use by 1% (50% max).</TM_Arcalleum.description>
  <TM_Demonhide.label>demonhide</TM_Demonhide.label>
  <TM_Demonhide.description>The skin of a demon. This material is incredibly tough with a micro-porous material mesh able to rapidly diffuse heat and cushion impact blows better than most non-metals. The blood of a demon is resistant to magic and leather made from the hide of a demon absorbs some of this resistance. Any enchantments carved into demonhide are naturally augmented. There are only two downsides to this material - the first is that it can only be acquired from the carcass of a demon, which makes it both rare and costly; the second is that it makes a terrible insulator.</TM_Demonhide.description>
  <TM_Demonscale.label>demonscale</TM_Demonscale.label>
  <TM_Demonscale.description>Pried from the body of a demon, these scales offer a lightweight and versatile defense against all forms of attack. Demon scale excels as a natural barrier to magic and is an excellent inhibitor to heat and fire; a warrior with enough armor crafted from demon scale may even become immune to all but the most intense fire. Demon scale can be smelted, and weapons forged from this refined metal make excellent bladed weapons. Enchantments etched into demon scale equipment are naturally augmented.</TM_Demonscale.description>

  <TM_Ruunbled.description>This a massive blade is etched in intricate runes from hilt to tip. It is forged in a material unknown to you, with a razor sharp edge and weighing only a fraction of what the size infers. Despite its size, the weapon is easy to handle, and practically hums with power. You can only fathom the origins of this weapon - perhaps crafted in ancient technologies that were lost to time or fabricated with some mysterious power. The only hint is small word written in a stylish script and imprinted into the hilt with the name "Ruunbled." You are not sure if this is a manufacturing company, the name of its maker, or the name of the blade itself. Whichever it is, there is no doubt that this weapon represents the pinnacle of its class.

The bow is said to be almost sentient, able to determine the intended target through a mental link with the wielder. Arrows fired from this bow almost always hit their intended target.

The fabric is difficult to focus on in a way that can only be described as "visual noise" and the folds of cloth move in an unnatural way as if unrestrained by natural law. Those few who have worn this cloak in battle swear that it possesses a consciousness of its own and tell stories of the cloth shielding them from certain destruction.  Others claim those observations were nothing but hallucinations by deranged fools. Because of these claims, it is rumored that the cloak possesses the ability to completely mitigate attacks against the wearer, but no one has been able to reproduce these results with any reliability.

When consumed raw, it generates a mild euphoric sensation of mental well-being and has been found to open up mental pathways, expanding consciousness.</TM_RawPomanasyrrium.description>
  <TM_RawPomanaMash.label>mashed pomana</TM_RawPomanaMash.label>
  <TM_RawPomanaMash.description>A bitter and unappetizing byproduct when extracting syrrium from raw pomonasyrrium. This byproduct retains some nutritional value but is largely left for animal consumption or as a nutrient base for meals.</TM_RawPomanaMash.description>
  <TM_Syrrium.label>syrrium</TM_Syrrium.label>
  <TM_Syrrium.description>Syrrium is distilled from pomana through a process boiling the mashed fruit which separates the syrrium from the pomana. Syrrium induces a much more intense effect than raw pomana when consumed. The chemical effects qualify the liquid as a drug and can cause mild chemical dependency, however, the its more addictive lure is when some begin to feel less capable without the drug and consume syrrium to maintain their confidence and mental balance.

The claims that pomanasyrrium grant insight and clarity is disregarded by most as lore or fantasy, however, research into its chemistry has revealed that these effects are indeed real, at least for mages. The benefits of syrrium are considered the primary reason to cultivate pomanasyrrium. When properly refined, the effects of syrrium have been found to expand a mages access to mana, accelerating its ebb and flow, and decreasing the effort required when exerting arcane power. These effects will not stack with benefits gained by consuming the raw fruit.</TM_Syrrium.description>

  <TM_Plant_Paracyte.label>Paracyte thornbush</TM_Plant_Paracyte.label>
  <TM_Plant_Paracyte.description>The paracyte thornbush is a genetically engineered plant that absorbs mana through a process of arcane transpiration and collects it into a chrysalis. As the plant matures, the chrysalis hardens into magicyte which can be harvested.  The rest of the plant consists of almost glass-like thorns and rigid stems. 
	
Paracyte is difficult to grow and only skilled herbalists are able to plant and harvest it safely, but for all it's difficulties, it has a delicate beauty and gives off an ethereal glow that reflects light along its crystalline edges.

NOTE: Paracyte plants will lower mana regen for all mages on the map if the number of paracyte plants exceeds the soft cap. Check mod settings for the soft cap value. Paracyte plans have no effect on mana regen when the total count on the map is lower than the soft cap.</TM_Plant_Paracyte.description>
