  <WanderingLich.letterText>An ancient lich has wandered into the area and is preparing to assault your colony.\n\nLichs are powerful creatures by themselves, but their true strength resides in their ability to create animated undead from the corpses of the deceased.\n\nThis lich is an ancient being that despises all life, and your merry band of living -things- has so far resisted being snuffed out. It will actively seek to end your story of survival by creating a horde of undead to overwhelm your defenses.\n\nThe lich will periodically create new skeleton warriors to attack the colony; allowing the lich to complete a ritual near an exposed corpse will increase the chance skeleton giants are created. Ultimately, the lich will assault the colony itself, if waves of undead are unable to complete the task first.</WanderingLich.letterText>

  <TM_ManaStorm.letterText>Chaotic forces are causing a dangerous mana tides.\n\nDuring a mana storm, attempts to use mana to realize magical intent external to the caster will harm the caster proportionally to the mana cost of the spell. This damage is applied before the spell incantation begins. Unformed use of mana and internal use of magic, such as the transfer of mana or dispelling an enchantment is unaffected. Magic circles or foci cannot be used during this event. While the mana storm is active, energy costs are halved and mana reduction limit is removed.</TM_ManaStorm.letterText>
