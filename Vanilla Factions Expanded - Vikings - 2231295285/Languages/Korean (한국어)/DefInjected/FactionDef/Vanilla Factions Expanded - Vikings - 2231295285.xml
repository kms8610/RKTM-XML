  <VFEV_VikingsClan.description>These clanmen have been here for a long time. Perhaps their ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago, as their legends suggest. In any case, the nordmen are fierce people who live off of the work of others, and they are not afraid to use force to take what's not theirs.\n\nAlbeit not as technologically advanced as other factions, the nordmen can be a valuable ally and a terrible enemy due to their hardiness and savage, heathen ways.\n\nThis particular clan values warlike dominance; it may be difficult to turn them into an ally.</VFEV_VikingsClan.description>
