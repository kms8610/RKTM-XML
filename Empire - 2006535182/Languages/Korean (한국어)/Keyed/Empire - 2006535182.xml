  <DeathOfFactionPawn>Your incompetence has led to the death of a pawn from your settlements! Unrest has grown in your subject settlements.</DeathOfFactionPawn>
  <CaptureOfFactionPawn>Capturing one of your settlement's pawns has caused great unrest in your subject settlements!</CaptureOfFactionPawn>
  <UnpaidTitheEffect>Unrest has increased by 10 and happiness has decreased in the settlement! </UnpaidTitheEffect>
  <AlreadyUpgradeSettlement>This settlement is already being upgraded!</AlreadyUpgradeSettlement>
  <StartUpgradeSettlement>The settlement is now being upgraded...</StartUpgradeSettlement>
  <BuildingInvalidEnvironment>That building cannot be built on this settlement's biome!</BuildingInvalidEnvironment>
  <FCDescSeaIce>Endless sheets of ice unbroken by nothing, little animals, and no food except that which is grown in heated rooms. Only the most tenacious of life survives here.</FCDescSeaIce>
  <FCDescIceSheet>Bleak, unending frost blankets the land, interrupted only by outcroppings of stone and ruins. The only source of food is the hardy wildlife which calls this place its home.</FCDescIceSheet>
  <FCDescTundra>The hinterland houses a variety of rugged flora and fauna eking out an existance on the moss-covered landscape. When the summer comes, the land blooms into life, if only briefly.</FCDescTundra>
  <FCDescColdBog>The rugged beauty of this land is matched only by its inhospitability. Marshes dot the landscape, as do frequent packs of migrating herbivores and the predators that follow them.</FCDescColdBog>
  <FCDescBorealForest>While typically less cold than the hinterland of a tundra, a boreal forest's harsh weather is only matched by its warm summers, where green blooms and food becomes plentiful until next winter.</FCDescBorealForest>
  <FCDescTropicalRainforest>Trees choke the sky, ensuring little light reaches the floor. Regardless, there is a dazzling, but deadly, array of flora and fauna. The beauty of this biome is matched only by the dangers within.</FCDescTropicalRainforest>
  <FCDescTemperateForest>Abundant forests and streams split the land. Animals roam the thick forests and both food and shelter are aplenty.</FCDescTemperateForest>
  <FCDescTemperateSwamp>The land is covered by bogs and marshes, and what isn't, is covered by a variety of vegetation. Available building space is at a premium here.</FCDescTemperateSwamp>
  <FCDescTropicalSwamp>Both the sky and ground is strangled by vegetation, as trees reach for the sky, ensuring little light reaches the treacherous grounds. Disease is rampant and frequent.</FCDescTropicalSwamp>
  <FCDescAridShrubland>While not a true desert, growing soil is at a premium thanks to the relentless heat. Most of the land is open, with secluded groves breaking the otherwise empty skyline.</FCDescAridShrubland>
  <FCDescDesert>Arable soil is a rarity, as the majority of the land here is covered in sand, some too treacherous to build on.  Still, life clings to existance here, and the sands harbour a vibrant array of life</FCDescDesert>
  <FCDescExtremeDesert>The sun has baked this land into a wasteland. There is almost no soil that can support proper vegetation, and that which there is, is poor in quality. </FCDescExtremeDesert>
  <FCDescUnknown>Little is widely known about the surrounding land, but the colony manages to survive and prosper in their present conditions.</FCDescUnknown>
  <FCTownLevel1>The settlement itself is simply a small cluster of buildings grouped around a central structure.</FCTownLevel1>
  <FCTownLevel2>The settlement is dominated by a few large structures, but it is still quite small. A number of sandbags and barricades ring the outside.</FCTownLevel2>
  <FCTownLevel3>The settlement has a good number of structures, largely production oriented, as well as dedicated storehouses, and busy workers scurry between them. A modest wall protects the settlement.</FCTownLevel3>
  <FCTownLevel4>The settlement is reasonably large, and well organised, with a number of industrial buildings clustered together to maximize efficiency. A thick wall and internal defenses protect the colony from attack.</FCTownLevel4>
  <FCTownLevel5>Clearly labelled buildings mark the industrial heart of this bustling beacon of civilization, as well as various other utilities . Multiple walls ring the colony, with plentiful interior defenses in carefully planned chokepoints.</FCTownLevel5>
