  <RH2_GruppaKrovi.description>Gruppa Krovi is a PMC (Private Military Company) established by a man known only by the name of "Volkov". A man rumoured to be an ex-FKGB operative back in the FSSR (Federation of Soviet Socialist Republics). Successfully convincing the heads of state of his private army's necessity, Gruppa Krovi flourished under Volkov's reign and they were sent wherever the Red Army wasn't allowed to operate in an official capacity, this included unofficial engagements with the UCA (United Commonwealth of America), of which is the Soviet Federation's nemesis in a seemingly unending cold war.\n\nGruppa Krovi is known to take ex-armed forces recruits and prisoners with no hope for a future, promising them wealth and freedom in exchange for their body and soul, serving the Motherland's well oiled war machine. They often have Soviet engineered war machines providing support for their infantry, and are often known to secretly borrow personnel from the Red Army, such as the Spetsnaz when necessary. The Soviet Federation had begun annexing foreign land in different planets through the use of this PMC in an attempt to expand the soviet influence, dubbed by their western enemies as the "Red Eclipse".\n\nThis group has its own fair share of controversies and alleged mistreatment of civilians and prisoners of war, such as links to organized crime.\n\nTheir leader, Volkov, is often reported KIA (Killed in Action) but somehow manages to resurface as alive and well with each report.</RH2_GruppaKrovi.description>
