  <OGO_Apparel_LevaElmet.description>Orkish Armour is the basic type of Ork Armour. It is usually made from sections of armoured plates and scavenged pieces of armour, battered into shape so that it fits its wearer (well, sort of). It usually includes huge metal pauldrons and other metal plates bolted together, or even riveted onto the Ork himself. 'Eavy armour has a ramshackle, improvised appearance, but offers far more protection then its humble origins can suggest. It is cumbersome to wear, but is commonly worn by Nobz and Warbosses, as extra protection goes a long way in a society where fighting (often to the death) is the usual form of career advancement. Those Ork Boyz who manage to get their hand on a piece of 'Eavy Armour are called 'Ard Boyz, and usually comprise mobs of their own.</OGO_Apparel_LevaElmet.description>

  <OG_Snotling.description>A Snotling is an Orkoid, the smaller cousin of Gretchins and Orks. Snotlings are often used by their larger counterparts as cannon fodder, food or even ammunition in certain cases. Snotlings represent the lowest rung of Orkoid society and are bullied by all other Greenskins. Snotlings often wield mushrooms or sticks into battle.\n\nA Snotling appears to be a miniaturised Gretchin. It stands roughly half a metre tall and has the same gangly appearance as a tiny Grot. Because of their small stature in the Orks' "might makes right" "kultur," they occupy what is perhaps the lowest rung of Ork society. While the Gretchin act as servants and maintain other secondary positions in Ork society, Snotlings will serve sometimes as "pets," but more often they are placed in Orkish agricultural and animal husbandry roles due to their affinity with the fungus and Squigs that feed most Ork settlements. Snotlings' affinity with Squigs usually ensures that only a few dozen Snotlings are eaten by their "livestock" on any given day. Supervised and trained by Runtherdz, Snotlings will cultivate the fungus preferred by Greenskins to provide Orks with food, drink, and medicine.</OG_Snotling.description>

  <OGO_Melee_CrudeChoppa.description>Choppas are a general term given to any Ork close combat weapon, typically heavy swords and axes. Slugga Boyz are always armed with a Slugga and Choppa, at least until they save up enough teef to buy something better, like a Shoota. There is little finesse to a Choppa, as most are little more than sharpened pieces of scrap metal which have been roughly shaped into something resembling a sword or axe. There are, however, more advanced choppas, often taking the form of a crude Chainsword.</OGO_Melee_CrudeChoppa.description>

  <OGO_Melee_WeirdboyStaff.description>Force Weapons are advanced, psychically-attuned close combat weapons that are only effective in the hands of a psyker. Force Weapons effectively act as deadly, psychic extensions or amplifiers of the wielder's own Empyrean-spawned powers. They are designed to allow a psyker to channel deadly Warp energies into their victim, acting as a conduit between the wielder's mind and the flesh of his target. Large alien monstrosities and daemons that are resilient to conventional weapons can be slain outright by a single wound from a Force Weapon, as their bodies and minds are destroyed by the unearthly powers of the Immaterium.</OGO_Melee_WeirdboyStaff.description>
