  <Plutonium.ProjTypeLabel>Production</Plutonium.ProjTypeLabel>
  <Plutonium.ResearchDesc>Plutonium is produced within used nuclear fuel. Used fuel can be reprocessed to extract this plutonium to create MOX fuel, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, and nuclear weapons. The process requires chemfuel and produces drums of depleted uranium and nuclear waste.</Plutonium.ResearchDesc>
  <Plutonium.ResearchDescDisc>You can now reprocess spent nuclear fuel.\n\nThe amount of material that will result from reprocessing is based on the conversion ratio stat of the fuel, with a maximum of 0.6x using normal reactors, and 1.2x using upgraded breeder reactors. This stat can be viewed by rolling over fuel slots in the reactor console.\n\nThe process of loading used fuel into the processor will require protective radiation suits, and shielding from the rest of the colony. Plutonium is stored in a protective case which is safe to handle.</Plutonium.ResearchDescDisc>
