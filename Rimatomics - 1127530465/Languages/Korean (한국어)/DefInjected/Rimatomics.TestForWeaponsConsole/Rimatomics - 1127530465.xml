  <EnergyWeapons7.description>Construct a Pulsed Power Container (PPC) and connect it to the same power net as the SACS.\n\nThese ultra-capacitors are much more efficient than standard batteries and are designed to provide the large jolts of power required by Rimatomics energy weapons. They are housed in a waterproof container and charged with excess power like a standard battery. We recommend using transformers to create isolated powernets for your PPC's and weapon arrays</EnergyWeapons7.description>
