They view themselves as engineer-mystics dedicated to the Omnissiah, and each Enginseer possesses a wealth of knowledge on how to maintain and repair mechanical and electronic technology. Unlike most of the Priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus, Enginseers can be found serving in almost every Imperial institution (other than the Adeptus Astartes, where the same role is played by the Techmarines), and are often assigned to regiments of the Imperial Guard or other parts of the Adeptus Terra.

  <OGIG_Apparel_TempestusScion_CarapaceArmour.description>Carapace Armour is generally a sign of status and is mostly worn by Imperial officers and agents. Made from moulded plates of armaplas, ceramite, or other strong, light but highly resistant materials, it can cover the entire body or just selected regions of the body depending on the desired level of protection. Tempestus Scions, for example, wear full-body suits of Carapace Armour, including an Omnishield Helm with a built-in targeting and imaging array, while most rank-and-file Astra Militarum soldiers are lucky to gain access to just a simple chestplate of Flak Armour to wear over more comfortable mesh or flakweave suits. Some bodysuits have slots designed for simple carapace plates to be inserted in, so that the overall suits can be rapidly configured for as much or as little protection as desired. Damaged plates can in this way be more easily replaced without requiring the purchase of an entire new suit.</OGIG_Apparel_TempestusScion_CarapaceArmour.description>

  <OGIG_Apparel_TempestusScion_CarapaceHelmet.description>The Omnishield Helm is a special helmet used by Imperial Tempestus Scions. In hostile environments, a Tempestus regiment will don all-enclosing Omnishield Helms, their respmasks proof against everything from industrial pollution to fully ignited atmospheres. When sealed, they allow Tempestus Scions to operate even in airless vacuums for limited periods of time. The multi-spectral occulum that attaches via suction to the wearer's eye sockets allow him to see in low light and occluded conditions with relative ease.</OGIG_Apparel_TempestusScion_CarapaceHelmet.description>
  <OGAS_Apparel_PowerArmour.label>Sororitas Power Armour</OGAS_Apparel_PowerArmour.label>
  <OGAS_Apparel_PowerArmour.description>Power Armour is an advanced form of powered combat armour, worn primarily by the Space Marines and the Chaos Space Marines, though suits have been created to be worn by mere mortals. It is a completely enclosed suit of combat armour composed of shaped Adamantium and Plasteel plates, encased in a Ceramite ablative layer. Each suit possesses a full suite of life-support functions for operation in hostile environments, an automated medicae system to provide some level of first aid to a wounded wearer and a highly advanced and fully integrated tactical targeting and threat analysis system known as Auto-senses. The suit would be heavy and cumbersome to wear but for the electrically motivated fibre bundles within the armour that replicates the wearer's movement and enhances his strength beyond its already considerable superhuman baseline (for Space Marines). Whilst Power Armour is most commonly associated with the Space Marines of the Adeptus Sororitas, the Sisters of Battle and many Inquisitors also use powered armour of one sort or another. Typically, however, these armours may not contain the same strength-enhancing properties or life-support functions of Space Marine Power Armour, nor do they always provide the same level of protection.</OGAS_Apparel_PowerArmour.description>

  <OGI_Wargear_Rosarius.description>A Rosarius is a symbol of office for the clerical members of the Adeptus Ministorum and is also a symbol of office for the Chaplains of the Space Marines alongside the Crozius. A Rosarius normally takes the form of a gorget, amulet, or signet ring of adamantium usually shaped into the form of the Imperial Aquila or a Gothic Cross with a jewel in the centre, and houses a powerful protective Conversion Field emitter, protecting the Ministorum's priest or the Space Marine Chaplain from attacks both physical and psychic that might otherwise break through the protection of even the mighty Space Marine Power Armour or the indomitable psychic strength of his own will. The field's effect is to convert the kinetic energy of an impact into harmless photons of the visible light spectrum. When the field stops a shot, a blinding flash of light is produced as the energetic conversion occurs. The field is capable of rendering even Plasma Gun shots harmless. It is worn around the neck or waist on a sash, a cord, or a string of prayer beads.</OGI_Wargear_Rosarius.description>
  <OGI_Wargear_IronHalo.label>Iron Halo</OGI_Wargear_IronHalo.label>
  <OGI_Wargear_IronHalo.description>The Iron Halo is a revered part of the Armoury of the Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes and is also a common Astartes award for valour. The Iron Halo is a halo-shaped ring that is positioned above the head of the wielder, usually mounted on the backpack of Space Marine Power Armour but sometimes mounted in the gorget. The Iron Halo is a prestigious honour that is granted only to the most exceptional of the Astartes within a Space Marine Chapter as a reward for uncommon initiative and valour. It is most often worn by the Chapter's Captains and Chapter Master, though Veteran Astartes and Sergeants can also earn the right to add it to their armour in certain circumstances. The Iron Halo appears to share the same basic technological mechanisms as the Space Marine Chaplain's Rosarius, as they both produce a protective effect using gravitic and now poorly-understood Conversion Field technology.</OGI_Wargear_IronHalo.description>

  <OGI_Wargear_CombatShield.description>A Combat Shield is piece of defensive equipment utilised mainly by the forces of the Adeptus Astartes, Combat Shields are usually fabricated from plasteel, and incorporate a form of technology very similar to that of Imperial Power Weapons in the form of a miniaturised power generator which, when activated, emits a field of disruptive energy around the face and circumference of the shield. A Combat Shield is a compromise between flexibility and defence, trading the stronger field and physical protection a Storm Shield's size offers for a free hand.\n\nCombat Shields Protect against melee attacks Only</OGI_Wargear_CombatShield.description>
  <OGI_Wargear_StormShield.label>Storm Shield</OGI_Wargear_StormShield.label>
  <OGI_Wargear_StormShield.description>A Storm Shield is a Power Shield that is used by the Space Marines and sometimes by Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus to provide an extreme form of protection. The Storm Shield is a much larger and rarer version of the Combat Shield and is usually used by only the most decorated of Astartes, often Vanguard Veterans or Veterans wearing Terminator Armour. Unlike the Combat Shield, which is attached to the user's arm and thus allows the hands to remain free, the Storm Shield is heavier and needs to be carried in one hand.\n\nCombat Shields Protect against melee attacks Only</OGI_Wargear_StormShield.description>

They are especially effective at punching clean through even the Ceramite plates of Power Armour. As their name implies, these bolts were developed by the Imperium specifically to target the Chaos Space Marines of the Traitor Legions.</OGI_Bolt_Vengeance.description>

  <OGI_HeavyBolt_Hellfire.description>Hellfire bolts were created as one of the Imperium's desperate measures to stem the predations of Tyranid assaults within the galaxy. Each bolt is tipped with thousands of needles and a vial of mutagenic acid capable of dissolving its way through citin and carapace with equal ease.\n\nWhen the round enters the target's body, the vial shatters and the needles pierce the victim's flesh, pumping the acid into the target. Such is the success of the Hellfire bolt that it has found a use against a variety of foes, its acid just as effective at killing other foul xenos.</OGI_HeavyBolt_Hellfire.description>

  <OGC_Melee_ChainSword.description>The Chainsword is the preferred close combat melee weapon of many of the military forces of the Imperium of Man. The Chainsword is essentially a sword with powered teeth that run along a single-edged blade like that of a chainsaw. Most versions of the weapon make use of monomolecularly-edged or otherwise razor-sharp teeth. Chainswords are not subtle weapons, and wielding one is a statement in its own right: they are horrific tools of war, designed to bite, tear and eviscerate where more primitive blades merely cut and slice. The weapon makes an angry buzzing sound as the teeth spin around, intensifying into a high pitched scream as they grind into armour. It is not unlike a modern chainsaw, but lighter and able to be wielded with one hand. It is often used in conjunction with a Laspistol.</OGC_Melee_ChainSword.description>

  <OGC_Melee_PowerFist.description>A Power Fist (also known as a Power Glove) is essentially an over-sized, armoured gauntlet that generates an energy field around it, one that is capable of violently disrupting any solid matter it touches. It is a favoured close combat weapon for many warriors of the Imperium of Man, as well as the Forces of Chaos (particularly the Chaos Space Marines). It is especially an iconic weapon of the Loyalist Space Marines. A Power Fist is large and slow in combat, and so the bearer must be willing to risk the blows of his enemy before he can strike back. However, a Power Fist vastly augments a user's strength, much as Power Armour does due to the power provided its mechanical servos. The disadvantages of its unwieldy nature are often well worth the limitations, as the combination of the disruptive power field and sheer physical strength afforded by a Power Fist allows a Space Marine to pulverize and tear apart armour plate from even the most well-protected of vehicles, and to wound and kill colossal monstrous creatures in close combat; its brutal effects against more mundane foes goes without saying. It is most commonly found fitted to Space Marine Tactical Dreadnought (Terminator) Armour.</OGC_Melee_PowerFist.description>

Force Weapons effectively act as deadly, psychic extensions or amplifiers of the wielder's own Empyrean-spawned powers. They are designed to allow a psyker to channel deadly Warp energies into their victim, acting as a conduit between the wielder's mind and the flesh of his target. Large alien monstrosities and daemons that are resilient to conventional weapons can be slain outright by a single wound from a Force Weapon, as their bodies and minds are destroyed by the unearthly powers of the Immaterium.</OGC_Melee_SorcerersStaff.description>

Powerful and utilitarian side arms, Bolt Pistols have seen service within many of the Imperium's military forces since its inception in the 30th Millennium. The current standard pattern in use amongst the Space Marines is the Mark III. Bolt Pistols are also used by many other Imperial forces as well as the Chaos Space Marines.

It is a powerful assault weapon that fires explosive kinetic rounds colloquially referred to as bolts. The Bolter is a weapon synonymous with the Adeptus Astartes, and rightly so. However, although the Space Marines are its primary users, the Bolter finds itself in use in military organisations throughout the Imperium. The weapon is fearsome, with explosive rounds capable of ripping through or blowing apart a foe. The Chaos Space Marines of the Traitor Legions were issued their Legions' Bolters before the Horus Heresy, and therefore use generally older variants than the patterns available to present-day Loyalist Space Marines.</OGC_Gun_BoltGun.description>

Instead, Storm Bolters are the standard weapons employed by Space Marine Terminators or as a pintle-mounted weapon on an Imperial main battle tank. Storm Bolters are also used by the Astartes of the Grey Knights Chapter as a gauntlet-mounted weapon with its feed located on the rear of their armour. The Storm Bolter also sees limited use amongst the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, where it is considered a specialist weapon, and favoured by those squads of Dominions, the Sororitas' heavy-weapons troops, who prefer to engage in mid-range, anti-infantry combat.</OGC_Gun_StormBolter.description>

The Laspistol is powered by a miniature power pack that is usually placed within the grip. The Laspistol is used most often by officers or Commissars of the Imperial Guard in conjunction with a close combat weapon, often a Chainsword or Power Sword. The Laspistol was specifically intended to allow the user to fire one-handed and wield a melee weapon in the other hand. The Laspistol is also a favoured weapon of Tech-priest Enginseers and Sanctioned Psykers.\n\nThe Laspistol is capable of producing the same amount of damage in a skilled user's hands as the Lasgun, yet it has drastically reduced range as compared to its variant rifle form. The Laspistol lacks the Lasgun's selective fire options, having only the ability to fire single shots.</OGC_Gun_LasPistol.description>

  <OGC_Gun_LasGun.description>The Lasgun, also sometimes referred to as a Lasrifle, is a directed-energy antipersonnel weapon used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man, and it is the most common and widely-used type of laser weapon in the galaxy. It is standard-issue for the Adeptus Mechanicus' cybernetic Skitarii infantry, all Astra Militarum rank-and-file infantry and most junior Astra Militarum officers. Lasguns are reliable, easy to maintain and to produce, and are readily available on most Imperial worlds. A Lasgun has a longer range than a Laspistol, but is nowhere near as powerful as a Lascannon nor does it possess the rapid-firing qualities of the Multi-Laser or the Hellgun. Though not as powerful as kinetic projectile weapons such as the ubiquitous Bolter, the lower cost of production, the lack of a requirement for ammunition production and resupply make the Lasgun the best choice for the large forces of the Imperial Guard. The Lasgun uses a small portable capacitor power pack to produce a focused pinpoint laser beam which is strong enough to take an ordinary human arm off with one shot but is not as effective against the more durable alien bodies and stronger types of personal armour. A Lasgun's beam also cauterizes the wounds it inflicts due to the immense heat given off by the shot. The Lasgun is effective when used en masse, but considerably less effective when used alone.</OGC_Gun_LasGun.description>

  <OGC_Gun_LasCannon.description>The powerful Lascannon is a formidable Laser Weapon whose energetic shot of coherent light is capable of penetrating most armoured vehicles. It is the favourite anti-tank weapon of the Imperial Guard and is also commonly used by the Space Marines. Its high strength and armour-piercing ability make it a formidable weapon and when it is twin-linked, it becomes even more deadly. However, it is very heavy and power-consuming, and must recharge after every shot, making it a poor anti-personnel weapon. As a result, it is usually installed on tanks or Sentinel platforms, and in the Imperial Guard, two-man teams are required to operate and carry around a single Lascannon. To accommodate the increased power output, the Lascannon has become the largest man-portable form of Las-weaponry, the barrel being several times larger in diameter and length than the standard Lasgun. Space Marines also make extensive use of the Lascannon.</OGC_Gun_LasCannon.description>

Most types of Melta Weapon like the Meltagun function by inducing highly pressurised gases from an ammunition canister into an unstable sub-molecular state which produces nuclear fusion and directing the resulting energies down the barrel. Melta Weapon usage is always accompanied by a distinctive hissing sound as the Melta beam boils away the water in the air, then a roaring blast as the beam reduces the target to charred scraps or molten slag. Meltaguns are the premier Imperial anti-armour weapons, and few if any vehicles can withstand their power.</OGC_Gun_MeltaGun.description>

The Sonic Blaster is the preferred weapon of Chaos Space Marine Noise Marines and Daemon Engines that serve the Chaos God Slaanesh. The Sonic Blaster is about the same size as the Astartes' man-portable Heavy Bolter, and is wielded with both hands. There exists a slightly larger variant of the weapon that is used by Chaos Sonic Dreadnoughts, where it is twin-linked with a second Sonic Blaster to cause even more destructive results.

The Reaper Autocannon was originally designed during the Great Crusade for use as a heavy support weapon for the Terminator Squads of the Space Marine Legions. The weapon features two barrels and is capable of a high rate of fire, but it requires the incredible strength available to those who wear Terminator Armour to be carried as an infantry-portable weapon. This is because the recoil of this weapon is too great for even Power Armour-wearing Space Marines to unleash it effectively.

It is a medium calibre rotary Autocannon, with its 6 barrels cycled by an electric motor past a single chamber. The Assault Cannon was developed after the end of the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium as a replacement for the Autocannon. Introduced during the Mark IIIA phase of Indomitus Pattern Terminator Armour development, this weapon is the standard alternative to the Heavy Flamer as a Terminator Squad's special ranged weapon. Its design has changed little in 10 Terran millennia, retaining the distinctively long, cylindrical, rotating barrels. Although it lacks the range of the Autocannon and many other Imperial heavy weapons, the Assault Cannon is a fearsome weapon when used at the close range role from which it was intended to be fired.</OGC_Gun_ReaperChaingun.description>

Second, an auto-burst trigger will continue to fire splinters for four to five seconds after it has been pulled, in case the user loses his grip temporarily during the charge. Finally, and possibly most important, is the addition of magneto-impulse directional spines along the barrel, and a secondary power generator housed in the back of the cannon, to prevent stalling or improper functioning. These directional spines provide additional magnetic field stability, preventing the splinters from exiting the barrel traveling at an awkward angle or hitting the inside of the barrel and causing damage to the weapon.\n\nThe Splinter Cannon otherwise contains the same mechanism for loading and firing ammunition, and comes with a very large ammunition crystal to allow for extended use of the cannon regardless of its high rate of fire.</OGDE_Gun_SplinterCannon.description>

A Scorpion's Claw also incorporates a Shuriken Catapult into the weapon's vambrace for ranged engagements, granting the Exarch a moderate amount of firepower while allowing him to wield another close quarter weapon in his other hand, and thus not hamper his close quarters prowess.</OGE_Melee_ScorpionsClaw.description>

Traditionally, every Shadowseer carries this iconic weapon -- its complex manufacture channels their mental force to crush armour plates and shatter bones. Against living victims, even a glancing blow from such a stave scrambles their perceptions, clouding the mind with contradictory illusions and reducing sight to a slow-motion blur. The Miststave is the Shadowseer's sign of office, and its tip is a totem of the Laughing God; the front a laughing face, the back a grinning skull.</OGE_Melee_Miststave.description>

Arguably the most iconic weapon that the masques carry to war, the Harlequin's Kiss is horrifically lethal. This weapon consists of a sharpened tube containing high-tensile monofilament wire, like those used in the Death Spinners, and is worn on the forearm. The Kiss is only effective in close combat. It contains a tightly-coiled retractable monofilament wire which is around 100 metres in length. When activated, usually by a forward punching motion, the wire is violently released. Capable of piercing armour, if the wire penetrates its victim it instantly uncoils and lashes around violently, liquefying bones and internal organs, and causing immediate death in a spectacular and bloody fashion. The wire then retracts back into the Kiss for another use.</OGE_Melee_HarlequinsKiss.description>

This weapon is essentially a Witchblade that can be thrown a short distance, automatically returning to the user's hand after each throw and is thus considered both a melee and a limited ranged weapon. However, it is a two-handed weapon that is heavy and difficult to wield, so its use in close combat is less effective than other Eldar blades.</OGE_Melee_SingingSpear.description>

Amongst humans these weapons are sometimes referred to as "slingers" or "sling pistols." The shorter barrel length and smaller capacity reduces the weapon's efficiency and so limits the range, rate of fire and power. The shurikens it fires are identical to those used in the larger weapon; a spinning disc which can slice straight through flesh and bone. Certain Eldar heroes and warriors, such as Striking Scorpion Aspect Warriors, use Shuriken Pistols as their main weapon.

All citizens of the craftworlds are trained in the use of the Shuriken Catapult as part of their preparation to form the Guardian militia in times of conflict.

It is also hauntingly accurate due to its use of a sophisticated electromagnetic pulse to guide its lethal blasts to enemy targets.

Unlike the mass-produced weapons of the Imperium, these potent Eldar weapons are hand-grown by Bonesingers with specific attention paid to the eyesight and grip, creating a weapon perfectly adapted to its user. The Ranger Long Rifle uses a Gyrostatic Arm to keep the weapon stable, dispensing with the clumsy bipods that must be used by the lesser races with their Sniper Rifles. The Gyrostatic Arm also all but eliminates recoil. Whereas the artificial crystals used by Imperial laser–technology struggle to maintain a focused beam over long distances, the psychically-grown crystals used by Eldar laser weapons are able to focus a tight beam of coherent light over a much greater distance, allowing a skilled user to punch through weak points in armour at great distances.</OGE_Gun_RangerLongrifle.description>

It operates in the same manner as a Lascannon, firing a concentrated blast of coherent light that is primarily intended to destroy enemy vehicles. The Bright Lance is a far more efficient weapon than its cruder, human-made counterpart, in part due to its use of psychically-grown crystals to serve as a lasing matrix.

All these weapons, including the massive Doomweaver Cannon mounted on super-heavy Eldar gravity tanks and the Harlequin's Kiss used by the Harlequins, work on the same principle: a liquid form of the psycho-reactive substance known as Wraithbone is kept in stasis within the weapon's magazine. Once the weapon is activated, this substance will be forced by an electromagnetic propulsive field through an incredibly fine sift, and will solidify into a mass of threads, each one molecule thick, called mono-filaments which are razor sharp. This mass of threads, called a "spinner cloud," is then catapulted at the enemy with tremendous force. Being only one molecule in width, the filaments will have few difficulties in penetrating any armour through minute weaknesses in its molecular structure, and will wreak havoc on the body within, chopping it into a gory mess.</OGE_Gun_Deathspinner.description>

Like its cousin the Exitus Rifle, it is a masterpiece of Adeptus Mechanicus engineering and is custom-built for the requirements of the individual assassin. The Pistol is largely a backup weapon for the Exitus Rifle and is used in the rare circumstances the assassin is discovered, cornered, or in need of rapid-fire weaponry. With a built-in silencer and capable of penetrating most armor with ease, it is has saved the lives of many Vindicare Assassins. Like its rifle counterpart, the Exitus Pistol is capable of firing a variety of specialized ammunition. These include:\nShield-Breaker Rounds - Overload the personal Force Fields of the target.\nTurbo-Penetrator Rounds - Use a two-stage charge to punch a secondary round through the thickest armor.\nHellfire Rounds - Contain virulent bio-acidic toxins that can reduce targets to ash.</OGI_Gun_ExitusPistol.description>

  <OGI_Melee_ChainSword.description>The Chainsword is the preferred close combat melee weapon of many of the military forces of the Imperium of Man. The Chainsword is essentially a sword with powered teeth that run along a single-edged blade like that of a chainsaw. Most versions of the weapon make use of monomolecularly-edged or otherwise razor-sharp teeth. Chainswords are not subtle weapons, and wielding one is a statement in its own right: they are horrific tools of war, designed to bite, tear and eviscerate where more primitive blades merely cut and slice. The weapon makes an angry buzzing sound as the teeth spin around, intensifying into a high pitched scream as they grind into armour. It is not unlike a modern chainsaw, but lighter and able to be wielded with one hand. It is often used in conjunction with a Laspistol.</OGI_Melee_ChainSword.description>

This Chain Weapon is fitted with a crude version of the disruption field generator more commonly found on Power Weapons. Although very unwieldy and tiring to use, the Eviscerator is fully capable of bisecting an armoured man or tearing open the most blasphemously corrupted mutant in a single stroke of its gargantuan blade.

  <OGI_Melee_PowerFistS.description>A Power Fist (also known as a Power Glove) is essentially an over-sized, armoured gauntlet that generates an energy field around it, one that is capable of violently disrupting any solid matter it touches. It is a favoured close combat weapon for many warriors of the Imperium of Man, as well as the Forces of Chaos (particularly the Chaos Space Marines). It is especially an iconic weapon of the Loyalist Space Marines. A Power Fist is large and slow in combat, and so the bearer must be willing to risk the blows of his enemy before he can strike back. However, a Power Fist vastly augments a user's strength, much as Power Armour does due to the power provided its mechanical servos. The disadvantages of its unwieldy nature are often well worth the limitations, as the combination of the disruptive power field and sheer physical strength afforded by a Power Fist allows a Space Marine to pulverize and tear apart armour plate from even the most well-protected of vehicles, and to wound and kill colossal monstrous creatures in close combat; its brutal effects against more mundane foes goes without saying. It is most commonly found fitted to Space Marine Tactical Dreadnought (Terminator) Armour.</OGI_Melee_PowerFistS.description>

This tactical depth-of-use makes it a valued tool of Imperial law enforcement. Arbites shock troops employ the weapon in combination with the suppression shield in breaking up riots.

The second type of Combi-weapon is an amalgamation of two wholly different weapons into a single casing.\n\nOnly one component of the combined weapon can be fired at a time, and often the secondary weapon has very limited ammunition, enough for only one shot or short burst of fire. Such weapons augment the bearer's tactical flexibility, granting him a limited capacity to deal with threats that the main weapon would find hard or impossible to damage.\n\nA Standard Bolter with a Grav Gun attached that is useful for a variety of tactical necessities.</OGI_Gun_CombiGrav.description>

  <OGI_Bullet_BoltStalkerSilinced.description>Stalker Silenced Shells are Bolter rounds with low sound signatures, meant for covert fighting. They are often used in conjunction with an M40 Targeter System, an extended barrel, and a stock to create a sniping weapon system. A gas cartridge replaces both the propellant base and main charge for silent firing, but this sacrifices muzzle velocity as a result. A solidified mercury slug replaces the mass-reactive warhead for lethality at sub-sonic projectile speed. These rounds are used when stealth and precision are required.</OGI_Bullet_BoltStalkerSilinced.description>

  <OGI_Bullet_HeavyBoltHellfire.description>Hellfire bolts were created as one of the Imperium's desperate measures to stem the predations of Tyranid assaults within the galaxy. Each bolt is tipped with thousands of needles and a vial of mutagenic acid capable of dissolving its way through citin and carapace with equal ease.\n\nWhen the round enters the target's body, the vial shatters and the needles pierce the victim's flesh, pumping the acid into the target. Such is the success of the Hellfire bolt that it has found a use against a variety of foes, its acid just as effective at killing other foul xenos.</OGI_Bullet_HeavyBoltHellfire.description>

Unlike the Boltgun, it is relatively common in Imperial Guard armies and is also often used by the Space Marines. Heavy Bolters have a high rate of fire and are relatively cheap to field. A Heavy Bolter can also be mounted on the cupola pintle-mounts of a wide variety of Imperial armoured vehicles, as well as act as an anti-personnel weapon by Imperial fixed defences, including strongholds and other fortifications.</OGI_Gun_HeavyBolter.description>

The Laspistol is powered by a miniature power pack that is usually placed within the grip. The Laspistol is used most often by officers or Commissars of the Imperial Guard in conjunction with a close combat weapon, often a Chainsword or Power Sword. The Laspistol was specifically intended to allow the user to fire one-handed and wield a melee weapon in the other hand. The Laspistol is also a favoured weapon of Tech-priest Enginseers and Sanctioned Psykers.\n\nThe Laspistol is capable of producing the same amount of damage in a skilled user's hands as the Lasgun, yet it has drastically reduced range as compared to its variant rifle form.

  <OGI_Gun_Hellgun.description>A Hellgun, also called a Hot-shot Lasgun, is a pattern of Imperial Lasgun that possesses a more advanced and powerful laser generation system intended to provide more potent laser fire on-target. This makes the Hellgun superior in both range and power output compared to the standard-issue Lasgun. However, the higher power output requires superior quality power cells or the use of a separate backpack power supply, and the more complex inner workings of the weapon require more time and resources to manufacture than the standard Lasgun.

  <OGI_Gun_LasCannon.description>The powerful Lascannon is a formidable Laser Weapon whose energetic shot of coherent light is capable of penetrating most armoured vehicles. It is the favourite anti-tank weapon of the Imperial Guard and is also commonly used by the Space Marines. Its high strength and armour-piercing ability make it a formidable weapon and when it is twin-linked, it becomes even more deadly. However, it is very heavy and power-consuming, and must recharge after every shot, making it a poor anti-personnel weapon. As a result, it is usually installed on tanks or Sentinel platforms, and in the Imperial Guard, two-man teams are required to operate and carry around a single Lascannon. To accommodate the increased power output, the Lascannon has become the largest man-portable form of Las-weaponry, the barrel being several times larger in diameter and length than the standard Lasgun. Space Marines also make extensive use of the Lascannon.</OGI_Gun_LasCannon.description>

  <OGI_Gun_PlasmaGun.description>The Plasma Gun is a rifle-sized Plasma Weapon common to many of the armed forces of the Imperium of Man. It is classified as a special weapon and is carried by a variety of Imperial infantry, including Space Marines, Imperial Guardsmen and Storm Troopers. Like other infantry-carried plasma weapons, Imperial Plasma Guns are more powerful than plasma weapons used by xenos races but far more unstable as they have a chance to malfunction and even explode, wounding or even killing the wielder.\n\nPlasma Weapons make use of hydrogen fuel suspended in a liquid state in either fuel flasks or backpack containers. As the fuel is fed into the miniature fusion core inside the weapon, the hydrogen energises into the plasma state of matter which is held in the core by powerful magnetic containment fields. When fired, the fields dilate open and the plasma is ejected via a linear magnetic accelerator as a bolt of superheated matter akin to a solar flare in appearance and temperature. For this reason Plasma Weapons are sometimes colloquially called "Sun Guns" by the common population of the Imperium. Plasma Weapons tax their cooling systems considerably, and the Space Marines push the limits of their own resilience by using hydrogen in a higher quantum state than standard Imperial patterns.</OGI_Gun_PlasmaGun.description>

  <OGI_Gun_PlasmaCannon.description>The Plasma Cannon, also sometimes called the Heavy Plasma Gun, is an Imperial heavy weapon that relies on plasma technology to deliver lethal blasts of superheated matter to the target. Plasma Weapons work by using hydrogen fuel suspended in a cryogenic state, in either fuel flasks or backpack containers. As the fuel is fed into the miniature fusion core inside the weapon, the hydrogen energises into plasma which is held in the core of the weapon by powerful electromagnetic containment fields. When fired, the fields dilate open and the plasma is ejected via a linear magnetic accelerator as a bolt of superheated matter akin to a solar flare in appearance and temperature. This bolt will explode on impact and can generate the destructive heat of a small sun. For this reason, Plasma Weapons are sometimes called “Sun Guns” by the common Imperial population.</OGI_Gun_PlasmaCannon.description>

Cheap, rugged and reliable, it can be found throughout the Imperium, where it is appreciated for its decent damage and accuracy. Its main drawbacks are its weight and the need to carry a large amount of cumbersome ammunition for prolonged operations. The latter drawback has led to the Astra Militarum being equipped with Lasguns as its standard armament since the early 32nd Millennium. Xenos races such as the brutal Orks are known to take particular relish in using several of their own crude versions of these formidable automatic weapons, known as Sluggas, Shootas and Snazzguns.</OGI_Gun_AutoPistol.description>

  <OGI_Gun_HeavyStubber.description>A Heavy Stubber is the name given to a range of heavy-barrelled Auto Weapons used for sustained fire. Like Autoguns they are easily manufactured and maintained, and are commonly used by Imperial Guard forces across the Imperium. A mainstay support weapon on lower-technology level planets that cannot maintain laser weapons in working order due to technological or resource limitations, and also popular with outlaws and hive gangers, the Heavy Stubber is ideal for fighting off large numbers of enemies or even lightly armoured vehicles. Its high rate of fire makes up for its lack of strength and armour-piercing abilities.</OGI_Gun_HeavyStubber.description>

  <OGI_Gun_AutoCannon.description>An Autocannon is an automatic, self-loading heavy ballistic weapon that fires a high velocity hail of solid shells, and is used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man. It is an ancient weapon, but has nevertheless remained a widely-used piece of wargear throughout the Imperium's history. These rapid-firing weapons can lay down a burst of fire to cover advancing troops, or strafe enemy-held positions. Autocannons are considered ideally suited for attacking enemy vehicles and fortifications from long range.</OGI_Gun_AutoCannon.description>

  <OGI_Gun_AssaultCannon.description>The Assault Cannon is a ballistic six-barreled, self-loading rotary Autocannon, effective against infantry targets and light vehicles at close to medium range. It is a medium calibre rotary Autocannon, with its 6 barrels cycled by an electric motor past a single chamber. The Assault Cannon was developed after the end of the Horus Heresy in the early 31st Millennium as a replacement for the Autocannon. Introduced during the Mark IIIA phase of Indomitus Pattern Terminator Armour development, this weapon is the standard alternative to the Heavy Flamer as a Terminator Squad's special ranged weapon. Its design has changed little in 10 Terran millennia, retaining the distinctively long, cylindrical, rotating barrels. Although it lacks the range of the Autocannon and many other Imperial heavy weapons, the Assault Cannon is a fearsome weapon when used at the close range role from which it was intended to be fired.</OGI_Gun_AssaultCannon.description>

Most patrolling Arbitrators take advantage of this flexibility by carrying a variety of shotgun shell types so as to offer them different tactical options in the event of encountering a situation that requires their intervention. Over-engineered by a considerable margin, the weapon is also perfectly capable of being used as a large club in close combat. It is also designed for maximum psychological impact, with a very audible pump action (standard Arbites riot training makes use of this). The sound of a hundred Arbitrators simultaneously chambering their weapons has ended countless riots over the millennia. This pattern of combat shotgun is particularly widespread amongst the Arbitrators of The Periphery, and is broadly typical of the weapons favoured by Calixian Arbitrators.</OGI_Gun_ArbitesShotgun.description>

Because of the partially incorporeal nature of these blades, a Warscythe is capable of passing through defensive energy shields, such as those emitted by an Iron Halo, that would normally deflect almost any other form of attack. The entropic power field that also flickers about a Warscythe blade can disrupt almost any material known to man, leaving the victim’s underlying structure -- be it organic or inorganic -- vulnerable to the weapon’s cleaving impact.</OGN_Melee_WarScythe.description>

  <OGN_Gun_StaffOfLight.description>A Staff of Light is a device of arcane Necron technology that serves as both a symbol of rank and authority, as well as a potent weapon for Necron royals. Shaped like a traditional Necrontyr staff with an ornate headpiece, its haft is actually a disguised power generator rod; and the crest a finely tuned focussing device which allows the wielder to unleash searing bolts of viridian energy at a rapid rate towards the enemy. These beams are so potent that they are even capable of penetrating Astartes Power Armour with ease. As well as being capable of projecting devastating blasts of energy at range, a Staff of Light also serves a similar function to a Power Weapon in close combat. A Staff of Light is usually only found in the armouries of Necron royalty, including those belonging to Necron Overlords, Necron Lords or Necron Destroyer Lords. However, Crypteks of an unspecialised nature in their techno-sorcerous arts also commonly wield a Staff of Light in battle.</OGN_Gun_StaffOfLight.description>

Due to the ramshackle nature of Ork weaponry, every Slugga is different, but most if not all Sluggas are semi-automatic, large calibre side arms. Though not as sophisticated as most other weapons used in the Imperium, Sluggas are no less effective than other, more advanced side arms when used correctly. As far as the melee-focused Ork holding it is concerned, the effectiveness of a Slugga is of little importance, as long as it is big and makes a loud noise when it fires.</OGO_Gun_Slugga.description>

  <OGO_Gun_Shoota.description>A Shoota is a kinetic, ballistic weapon used by the Orks that is chosen not for its efficiency but for the amount of noise it makes and the amount of damage it can do. The best Shootas are deafening and deadly in equal measure. Like the Slugga, Shootas are not very accurate. This suits the Orks just fine since they seem less interested in accuracy than in causing damage and raising a ruckus. The noise of a Shoota will give Orks a morale boost and can cause enemies to lose their morale and retreat from the overpowering noise of dozens of Shootas. None the less, mobs of Shoota Boyz make up for their lack of accuracy with the sheer volume of fire directed at their targets.</OGO_Gun_Shoota.description>

Snazzguns vary as much in design as Shootas, but all are lethal in the extreme. Many Flash Gitz hard-wire their Snazzguns to their primitive bionics, incorporating a variety of barrels, scopes and targeting arrays into their cybernetics to maximise their Snazzgun's effectiveness -- not that this necessarily makes them any better shots, but it does make them feel bigger and cleverer as they are shooting. An individual Snazzgun shoots either bolts of energy or ballistic rounds, but not both. A Snazzgun, just like a Shoota, is inherently inaccurate and can do variable damage, as the velocity of its shots (if the weapon is of the ballistic variety) can vary.</OGO_Gun_Snazzgun.description>

These "Burnas" are long, stripped-down Flamers able to spray great gouts of oily flame, and are linked to a sloshing tank of volatile Promethium slung over their shoulder. Ork Boyz can modify their Burnas with special nozzles and valves that can be switched to force out a fierce blue tongue of fire instead of a cloud of orange flame. This "cuttin' flame" is powerful enough to slice through any material up to and including a metal bulkhead. In battle, Burnas prove extremely useful, as they can be utilised to flush out enemies hiding in ruined buildings and woods. When facing heavily armoured opponents such as Space Marines, Burna Boyz can simply switch to their cuttin' flames and use their Burnas to slice apart the foe.</OGO_Gun_Burna.description>

It's mainly used as a symbols of their office, ceremonial weapons, and in self-defence. While each weapon is custom-made, they all feature a broad blade fitted to a long, lightweight metallic staff. Ethereals use the blades primarily to settle disputes, engaging in lengthy, highly stylised duels that are more coordinated co-meditation than combat. The combatants dance and weave as if in a trance, their weapons flashing past one another scant millimeters and microseconds from causing terrible damage. Yet somehow, the dance is always bloodless, as if the Ethereals are in total union with one another. In truth, the combatants are engaged in a deeply spiritual duel, conducted at a level which none outside of their caste can discern. Some Ethereals carry their Honour Blades on the field of battle, not expecting to have to use them, but prepared to make a last stand against their foes nonetheless.</OGT_Melee_HonorBlade.description>

  <OGT_Gun_RailRifle.description>A Rail Rifle is a Tau ballistic Rail Weapon that makes use of electromagnetically-induced linear acceleration to fire a projectile at hypersonic speeds. A potent weapon, the Rail Rifle makes use of the same technologies as the larger Railgun and Heavy Rail Rifle, albeit on a smaller scale so that it is infantry portable. Possessing an impressive long range and ability to deal great damage, its true strength lies in its armour penetration capabilities. The Rail Rifle's projectile is able to punch through even Terminator Armour with ease. As a dedicated elite infantry killer, enemy units that manage to survive a Rail Rifle fusillade are often pinned down temporarily afterwards, unable to do anything in the face of such deadly fire.</OGT_Gun_RailRifle.description>

  <OGT_Gun_IonRifle.description>An Ion Rifle is an experimental Tau Ion Weapon designed for infantry use developed during the Tau Empire's Third Sphere Expansion. An Ion Rifle is similar in size to a Tau Rail Rifle, and it is a powerful weapon capable of engaging enemies at long ranges with high energy ion streams, vaporising flesh and metal with equal ease. These high-energy particles are accelerated by an electromagnetic field and react explosively with the target as a result of direct transfer of energy at an atomic level.</OGT_Gun_IonRifle.description>

  <OGT_Gun_BurstCannon.description>A Burst Cannon is a form of multi-barrelled Tau Pulse Weapon, and utilises the same plasma induction technologies found in a Pulse Rifle to fire micro-pulses of plasma accelerated to near-light speeds. With four rotating barrels to mitigate thermal stress, Burst Cannons are able to sustain ferocious rates of fire, albeit at the expense of the long ranges that many other Pulse Weapons possess. However, this drawback is usually offset by the Burst Cannon’s portability, and the manoeuvrability of units commonly armed with them.</OGT_Gun_BurstCannon.description>

  <OGT_Gun_NeutronBlaster.description>A Neutron Blaster is a unique and potent weapon utilised only by the Vespid, representing a technology unique to that alien species. A hybrid of Vespid and Tau technology, the bulk of a Neutron Blaster is of Tau manufacture as the Vespid have not yet attained the technical facility to fabricate it themselves. Mounted at the barrel of the weapon is a highly energetic and unstable crystal harvested from the lowest levels of the largest stalactite islands of the Vespid homeworld in the deepest reaches of Vespid's cloud seas. At such depths, the atmospheric pressures create all manner of exotic, bizarre and unique crystal formations, and it is only the larger female Vespid, those who form the leader class of the species, who have the constitution to descend to such depths and harvest the purest crystals.</OGT_Gun_NeutronBlaster.description>
