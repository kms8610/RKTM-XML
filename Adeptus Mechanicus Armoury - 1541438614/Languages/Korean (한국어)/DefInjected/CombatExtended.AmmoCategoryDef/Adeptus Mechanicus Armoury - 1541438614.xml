  <OGDistortionAC.description>a strong, armour-piercing weapon since no amount of armour can protect a foe from this dimension-warping attack. It functions by opening a small rift into the Warp into which the enemy is sucked.</OGDistortionAC.description>

  <OGGrenadeKrak.description>a shaped explosive charge capable of punching holes in armoured targets such as vehicles or bunkers, and its charge can even rip armour plating apart.</OGGrenadeKrak.description>
  <OGLasAC.label>Las Charge</OGLasAC.label>
  <OGLasAC.description>Focuses a throbbing bass note into an explosive sonic crescendo that can burst eyeballs and rupture internal organs. By varying the frequency of the blast, the effect of the weapon can be altered to produce different effects.</OGLasAC.description>

  <OGMonofillamentAC.description>Once the weapon is activated, this substance will be forced by an electromagnetic propulsive field through an incredibly fine sift, and will solidify into a mass of threads, each one molecule thick, called mono-filaments which are razor sharp. This mass of threads, called a "spinner cloud," is then catapulted at the enemy with tremendous force. Being only one molecule in width, the filaments will have few difficulties in penetrating any armour through minute weaknesses in its molecular structure, and will wreak havoc on the body within, chopping it into a gory mess.</OGMonofillamentAC.description>

  <OGNeedleAC.description>When fired it ejects a long sliver of hollow glass that can pierce a foe's skin and introduce the toxins straight into his bloodstream, invariably with horrific results.</OGNeedleAC.description>

  <OGSplinterAC.description>ammunition disintegration generator breaks up the crystal into shards, along with a cyclic ammunition feeder to house the shards before firing. Once fired, it routes the energy used to disintegrate the ammunition crystal through a magno-electric impulse chamber that accelerates the crystal to supersonic speeds, rocketing it towards its intended target.</OGSplinterAC.description>
