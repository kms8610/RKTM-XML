  <BionicArm.label>bionic arm</BionicArm.label>
  <BionicArm.description>An installed bionic arm. Silenced mini-servos give great strength, while the biogel nerve-link gives exquisite control. A lattice-dust healing system allows it to recover from damage. It is better than a biological arm in almost every way.</BionicArm.description>

  <BionicEar.label>bionic ear</BionicEar.label>
  <BionicEar.description>An installed bionic ear. A collection of invisible subdermal microphones capture sound and transmit it to a biogel nerve interface that links directly with the auditory nerve. It's sensitive enough to hear a cat before you see it, can't be damaged by loud noise, and automatically tunes itself to pick out meaningful sounds in noisy environments.</BionicEar.description>

  <BionicEye.label>bionic eye</BionicEye.label>
  <BionicEye.description>An installed bionic eye. With its biogel nerve-link, internal signal pre-processor, and wide-spectrum sensors, it is better than a biological eye in almost every way. A lattice-dust healing system allows it to recover from damage.</BionicEye.description>
  <BionicEye.labelNoun>a bionic eye</BionicEye.labelNoun>
  
  <BionicHeart.label>bionic heart</BionicHeart.label>
  <BionicHeart.description>An installed bionic heart. It has synthetic muscle fibers for a realistic heartbeat, plus a high-flow pump for rapid circulation during high stress. It is better than a biological heart in almost every way.</BionicHeart.description>
  <BionicHeart.labelNoun>a bionic heart</BionicHeart.labelNoun>
  
  <BionicJaw.label>bionic jaw</BionicJaw.label>
  <BionicJaw.description>An installed bionic jaw. Made out of biosynthetic bone, with plasteel tooth replacements and a set of micro servomotors for the full range of motion.</BionicJaw.description>
  <BionicJaw.labelNoun>a bionic jaw</BionicJaw.labelNoun>
  
  <BionicLeg.label>bionic leg</BionicLeg.label>
  <BionicLeg.description>An installed bionic leg. With its biogel nerve-link, powerful mini-servos, and lattice-dust healing system, it is better than a biological leg in almost every way.</BionicLeg.description>
  <BionicLeg.labelNoun>a bionic leg</BionicLeg.labelNoun>
  
  <BionicSpine.label>bionic spine</BionicSpine.label>
  <BionicSpine.description>An installed bionic spine. A biogel nerve bundle runs down an articulated plasteel core, surrounded by a lattice-dust healing system. It matches the performance of a biological spine.</BionicSpine.description>
  <BionicSpine.labelNoun>a bionic spine</BionicSpine.labelNoun>
  
  <BionicStomach.label>bionic stomach</BionicStomach.label>
  <BionicStomach.description>An installed bionic stomach. A person with this has a much lower chance of getting food poisoning, and is immune to some stomach diseases. An integrated lattice-dust healing system automatically repairs any damage to the artificial organ. It is better than a biological stomach in almost every way.</BionicStomach.description>
  <BionicStomach.labelNoun>a bionic stomach</BionicStomach.labelNoun>
  
  <BionicTongue.label>bionic tongue</BionicTongue.label>
  <BionicTongue.description>An installed bionic tongue. Made of synthetic smooth-fibers and connected through a neurogel interface, it can match the performance of a natural tongue in speaking, eating, and tasting.</BionicTongue.description>
  <BionicTongue.labelNoun>a bionic tongue</BionicTongue.labelNoun>
  
  <DeathAcidifier.label>death acidifier</DeathAcidifier.label>
  <DeathAcidifier.description>An installed death acidifier. Upon the user's death, it releases powerful chemicals that dissolve gear in contact with the user's body. It doesn't damage others.</DeathAcidifier.description>
  <DeathAcidifier.labelNoun>a death acidifier</DeathAcidifier.labelNoun>
