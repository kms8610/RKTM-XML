  <ResurrectionPsychosis.description>Chaotic thought patterns caused by the decoherence of resurrection mechanites. Resurrection psychosis progresses and eventually causes total psychosis and death.\n\nResurrected people require mechanites to rebuild their bodily functions at the cellular level. Mechanites always have a chance to lose coherence, and if they do, they wreak havoc in the central nervous system. The older the corpse, the more mechanite action is required to resurrect it, and the greater the chance of eventual decoherence.</ResurrectionPsychosis.description>

  <Scaria.description>A disease which causes affected creatures to enter berserk rages. A creature with scaria can be cured through a special medical operation, but it must be downed first. If not treated, scaria kills its host about five days after infection. The disease poisons the flesh and rots the skin, so creatures killed with scaria have a chance of rotting upon death so they cannot be butchered for meat or leather.</Scaria.description>
