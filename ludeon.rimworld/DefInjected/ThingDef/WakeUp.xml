  <WakeUp.description>A synthetic stimulant. Wake-up fills the user's need for rest, allowing them to work for extended periods without getting tired. Psycasters on wake-up gain more psyfocus from meditation than they otherwise would. However, taking wake-up runs the risk of developing an addiction.\n\nIn the most competitive universities and companies of many worlds, high-achievers are sometimes called 'wake-ups' because of the association with this drug.</WakeUp.description>
