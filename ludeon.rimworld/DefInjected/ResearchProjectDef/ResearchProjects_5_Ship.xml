  <ShipBasics.description>Construct the structural and supportive elements of a starship. This is the first step in building a ship to leave this star system.</ShipBasics.description>
  <ShipBasics.discoveredLetterText>Escaping from this planet - it would be freedom at last, and maybe a return home.\n\nBut also incredibly dangerous.\n\nA new Ship category is available in the Architect menu from which you may build ship parts once the appropriate technology is researched. Ships require several different parts in order to launch, including a ship reactor.\n\nShip reactors take 15 days to charge up and many desperate souls want off this planet. Once you begin that process, the ship reactor will emit an energy signature detectable from thousands of kilometers away. Raiders will flock to attack you in waves, with an intensity you've never seen. Mechanoids are also known to be attracted to such energy signatures.\n\nIt won't start until you activate your ship's reactor, but when it does, it'll be ferocious. You'll need to stockpile resources, weapons, and defenses for the onslaught if you hope to escape alive.</ShipBasics.discoveredLetterText>

  <ShipComputerCore.label>machine persuasion</ShipComputerCore.label>
  <ShipComputerCore.description>Build a reward-signal system to persuade an existing persona core into serving as a ship's machine captain. Since people sleep during interstellar travel, a persona core is necessary to handle the complex decisions of a years-long starflight.</ShipComputerCore.description>
  
  <ShipCryptosleep.label>vacuum cryptosleep casket</ShipCryptosleep.label>
  <ShipCryptosleep.description>Construct hardened cryptosleep caskets tough enough to be exposed to vacuum, for transporting people on the years-long journey between stars.</ShipCryptosleep.description>
  
  <ShipEngine.label>Johnson-Tanaka drive</ShipEngine.label>
  <ShipEngine.description>Construct a Johnson-Tanaka drive for a ship. The JT drive can push you to other stars by leveraging quantum scale effects to beam momentum to distant stars. Of course, as with all starships, it still takes many years to get anywhere.</ShipEngine.description>
  
  <ShipReactor.label>starship reactor</ShipReactor.label>
  <ShipReactor.description>Build a long-duration nuclear reactor to power a starship. Note that reactors have a long startup process that will attract raiders.</ShipReactor.description>
  
  <ShipSensorCluster.label>starflight sensors</ShipSensorCluster.label>
  <ShipSensorCluster.description>Construct long-range sensors for a starship. These sensors are essential for navigation, communication, and threat avoidance.</ShipSensorCluster.description>
