  <RH_141TaskForce.description>Task Force 141, colloquially referred to as "The One-Four-One," is a multinational special operations unit composed of members of British, Australian, American, Canadian and possibly other foreign personnel, usually those with previous Special Ops experience.
	
Notably during World War III, a rogue Lt. Gen. Shepherd betrayed Task Force 141 as a way of tying loose ends for his war crimes; subsequently all the remaining members of Task Force 141 were either eliminated or on the run at the conclusion of the crisis.

Task Force 141 found themselves hunted by both NATO allies and the Russian Federation during the war, but after rescuing Russian President Boris Vorshevsky and his daughter Alena in Siberia, Task Force 141 was reinstated and their names cleared with NATO and Russia officially approving of their actions.</RH_141TaskForce.description>
