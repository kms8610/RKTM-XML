  <HarbingerTreeSpawn.letterText>A harbinger tree has sprouted nearby. These gnarled trees grow flesh-like coverings, and can feed on corpses and raw meat placed nearby. If well fed, the grove will continue to grow.\n\nIn a tribal myth, these trees are the emissaries of a shapeless god who rules an endless black ocean. The myth ends after the shapeless god reaches up from the water and tears down the sky.</HarbingerTreeSpawn.letterText>
