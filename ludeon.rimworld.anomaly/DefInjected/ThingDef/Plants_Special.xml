  <Plant_TreeHarbinger.description>A gnarled tree that grows a flesh-like covering around a bioferrite skeleton. Harbinger trees are capable of feeding on corpses and raw meat, and will consume those placed nearby. If well fed, the grove will continue to grow.\n\nThe tree can be harvested for twisted meat and bioferrite.\n\nIn a tribal myth, these trees are the emissaries of a mad, shapeless god who rules an endless black ocean. The myth ends after the shapeless god reaches up from the water and tears down the sky.</Plant_TreeHarbinger.description>
