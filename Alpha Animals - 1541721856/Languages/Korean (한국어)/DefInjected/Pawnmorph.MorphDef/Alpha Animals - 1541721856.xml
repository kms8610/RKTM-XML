  <AA_AerofleetMorph.description>A hybrid animal / humanoid with Aerofleet characteristics.\n\nAs a floating creature, Aerofleetmorphs ignore terrain movement costs. Aerofleetmorphs slowly produce a thick, gelatinous substance known as Blue Gel. This syrupy residue can be collected and refined into an energy-dense compound, and potentially used to build powerful batteries and generators, with the appropiate research (Biofuel refining, Batteries and Advanced Fabrication).</AA_AerofleetMorph.description>

  <AA_AnimusMorph.description>An Animusmorph is a canine / humanoid hybrid with latent psionic abilities. It will quickly bond with other colonists and reach with its mind to make happy everyone that treats it well.</AA_AnimusMorph.description>

  <AA_HelixienMorph.description>The Helixienmorph is a hybrid Leopard Slug / humanoid. The Helixienmorph constantly secretes a foul-smelling, corrosive gas that produces an uncomfortable, itchy sensation in living beings. This gas is mostly harmless, unless it comes into contact with decaying organic matter: it greatly accelerates corpse rotting, liberating a black putrid liquid known as "purge fluid" or corpse bile. The helixienmorph feeds on this liquid sludge, although it can also feed on other organic matter if needed.\n\nThe sight of a Helixienmorph is quite revolting, and watching one wallowing in a pile of human corpses is, to say the least, a deeply traumatizing experience.</AA_HelixienMorph.description>
