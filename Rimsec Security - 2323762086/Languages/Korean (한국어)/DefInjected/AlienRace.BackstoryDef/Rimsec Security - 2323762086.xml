  <RSPeacekeeperBackstoryChildSentinel.baseDescription>Although the Defender and Enforcer could be wielded in superior numbers, for many users it was costly to maintain such numbers due to staggeringly high casualties and expensive repairs for damaged units. Eventually, Saturn Robotics Systems developed the Sentinel a heavy-duty multipurpose siege robot that is equipped with Saturn Robotics Systemsâ€™ heavy assault gun designated as the Sentinel Heavy Assault Gun 1 (SHAG-1). Although it was more costly than the Defenders and Enforcers, the Sentinel is a common face among armies featuring SRS combat units due to its sheer firepower and advanced armour.</RSPeacekeeperBackstoryChildSentinel.baseDescription>
