  <RH_VOID.description>Imagine an ancient fallen world, a planet that lost its people to a viral outbreak home to horrors that made the simple task of crossing the streets and procuring food, each day a matter of life and death. In this hopeless world came a group that helped what remained of the brilliant minds to significantly advance both in technological, and medical aspects for whoever was left, so that humanity's last could endure and have a fighting chance against all odds.\n\nLets suppose this group had found the cure, or the ability to control all of the infected to be as harmless as doves. However, what if this group had zero intentions of being their world's saviours? Then they choose to leave it all behind, abandon all the weak and ignorant while they venture through the stars to find a new world to toy with.\n\nWhat if you realize, that they played a part in the destruction that started all of that?\n\nThen maybe you already know the story of VOID.</RH_VOID.description>
