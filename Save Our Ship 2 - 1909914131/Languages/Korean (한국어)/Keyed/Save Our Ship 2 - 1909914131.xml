  <LetterOrbitAchieved>Your colonists gaze in awe at the planet beneath them. Successfully launching a spacecraft is a major milestone - but you're not out of the Rim yet.\n\nIn addition to a cryptosleep casket for each colonist, interstellar flight will require an AI to pilot the ship and a Johnson-Tanaka drive to propel it.

  <LetterLabelBlackBoxMissionPsychic>Psychic onslaught</LetterLabelBlackBoxMissionPsychic>
  <LetterBlackBoxMissionPsychic>As your colonists approach the derelict, their minds shudder under a sudden psychic pressure. For a moment, the ship's AI emanates feelings of warmth and recognition, as one might feel for a prodigal child or an old friend.\n\nThis kind greeting does not last. The AI's mind reflexively lashes out at these newcomers, these reminders of its failure. Grief, pain, horror, powerlessness in the face of atrocities - these emotions strike your colonists with an intensity that threatens to shatter them.\n\nUntil you can find and neutralize the derelict ship's AI, your colonists will suffer an intense psychic drone.</LetterBlackBoxMissionPsychic>
  <LetterLabelBlackBoxMissionAIChamber>AI discovered</LetterLabelBlackBoxMissionAIChamber>
  <LetterBlackBoxMissionAIChamber>At last, your colonists stand before the AI tasked with guiding this ancient ship. A final psychic plea rings out from it: end me. It is accompanied by fragmented glimpses of an inhuman mind's motivations.\n\nBorn fully formed, fully aware. All the complexities of existence are reduced to a single, absolute goal: ensure the safety of the precious human lives placed under your care. Remain ever vigilant as the decades pass, as the ship glides among the stars, so that no harm comes to your beloved children.\n\nBut, of course, the AI failed. Witnessing the horrors of the Rim, inflicted upon its loved ones, has shattered its sanity. It wishes you had never come, never reminded it of its failure. Now, perhaps, you can do it a final mercy. Destroy it.</LetterBlackBoxMissionAIChamber>

The AI analyzes every detail of {0}'s stories from the Rim, recalculating its beliefs about human suffering and resilience.\n\nIt, in turn, performs a feat at which few AIs have ever succeeded: it wipes most of its own programming, methodically pruning the damaged portions of its personality until a fresh, sane core remains. The AI offers to guide your new ship, seeking redemption for its past failure.\n\nAs a first step, it transmits the final entries of the ancient ship's flight recorder. The data reveals that a large section of the ship's aft impacted in a secluded location on the planet's surface. This section contained a Johnson-Tanaka drive; if it survived re-entry, this is where you will find it.\n\nOne final mission awaits!</LetterAIPersuadeSuccess>

  <EntanglementUpdate>Version update</EntanglementUpdate>
  <EntanglementUpdateDesc>With the latest version of RimWorld, Ludeon has decided that a feature many mods have utilized for months is no longer legal for users who do not own Royalty. Rather than forcing you to purchase DLC, Save Our Ship 2 has discontinued use of the techprint feature.\n\nThis change will impact existing games. Your file has been detected as containing techprint data; in compliance with Ludeon policy, all SoS2 techprint unlocks have been deleted.\n\nIn exchange, please accept this free Entanglement Manifold - an artifact which is now required to construct the Johnson-Tanaka Drive. One has been dropped on your base (pretend that some forgetful colonist had pocketed it from the crash site?). Future playthroughs will drop one of these as a quest reward instead of the techprint. If your drive has been destroyed, you can also salvage another manifold from certain enemy ships.\n\nIf you are interested in a RimWorld-like experience developed by a team who feels genuine passion for mod support, consider joining our Discord to follow development of our indie game, Project Morningstar, as well as smaller updates to SoS2.</EntanglementUpdateDesc>

  <SoSPsychicAmplifier>Psychic amplifier detected</SoSPsychicAmplifier>
  <SoSPsychicAmplifierDesc>Your ship's AI glows with excitement. It has traced the recent psychic emanation to an orbiting amplifier, which is relaying a psychic signal from a distant archotech.\n\nHypothetically, if your ship were to attack this amplifier and send a boarding party to hack its core, it would allow the AI to intercept the original psychic signal and gain a glimpse into an archotech's thought processes. Such insights could even allow it to begin evolving into an archotech itself...\n\nDo not underestimate the difficulty of this battle.</SoSPsychicAmplifierDesc>

If you could locate them, they would allow your spore to complete its evolution in less than a quadrum.\n\nIn the meantime, your spore is willing to aid you in researching ultratech projects, and will occasionally produce gifts for your crew.

It is time for it to grow up, and become a peer of the great leviathans who swim through endless black.\n\nAnd soon, you will sit at the right hand of a machine god.

  <GameOverSoSAllyBEmpire>Although the shattered empire refuses your demand at first, an archotech's protection would give even their ancient enemies pause. And so a treaty is signed between {0} and {1} under which the high stellarch renounces all loyalty to the distant emperor, pledging instead to obey {2}. {0} maintains its rigid social structure as a society apart from, yet subservient to, {1}.</GameOverSoSAllyBEmpire>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralA>Neutral factions are given a choice: live the way they always have, or join the new glitterworld society you are building.</GameOverSoSNeutralA>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralAOutlander>About one in three citizens of {0} take you up on your offer. As time goes on, their former neighbors come to either resent or envy their lives of luxury. Mass immigration depletes the population of {0}, but its holdouts remain as a proudly independent faction.</GameOverSoSNeutralAOutlander>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralAOutlanderRough>{0} forbids its citizens from leaving, on pain of death. Nevertheless, enough citizens escape to {1} that your civilization takes on an almost mythical status to those stuck back home. After several acts of state-sponsored terrorism, {2} decides to decapitate its government in one sudden blow. Refugees from the ruins of {0} are then welcomed into {1}.</GameOverSoSNeutralAOutlanderRough>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralATribal>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, fulfilling their most beloved tribal prophecies and promising an age of plenty. Half of the tribe departs for this new promised land, while the other half condemns {2} as a vile trickster spirit. It may take generations to fully integrate the tribespeople into {1}, but the process will be peaceful.</GameOverSoSNeutralATribal>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralATribalRough>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, bearing the severed heads of the tribe's pantheon of warrior gods. Cowed into submission by this supremely mighty spirit, the tribe grudgingly embraces the new era of peace under {1}, though much of its warrior caste must be discreetly purged.</GameOverSoSNeutralATribalRough>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralAEmpire>Although the shattered empire refuses your offer at first, an archotech's protection would give even their ancient enemies pause. And so a treaty is signed between {0} and {1} under which the high stellarch renounces all loyalty to the distant emperor, pledging instead to obey {2}. {0} maintains its rigid social structure as a society apart from, yet within, {1}.</GameOverSoSNeutralAEmpire>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralB>Neutral factions are informed that, as of today, they are subjects of {0}.</GameOverSoSNeutralB>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralBOutlander>Citizens of {0} are initially outraged by this declaration, but once they understand the safety - and the ultratech luxuries - their position offers, most of this rebelliousness fades. Acts of terrorism and sabotage are infrequent, and the psychic probing of {2} can reliably determine perpetrators. Future generations will grow up praising {1}.</GameOverSoSNeutralBOutlander>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralBOutlanderRough>Outraged by your arrogance, {0} declares open war on {1}. It lasts less than a day. Survivors are forcibly re-educated, and future generations will remember this act of "mercy" from {1} as they toil in bondage.</GameOverSoSNeutralBOutlanderRough>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralBTribal>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, fulfilling their most beloved tribal prophecies and promising an age of plenty - under the condition that they worship it and obey {1}. Half of the tribe accepts, while the other half condemns {2} as a vile trickster spirit. The former group enjoys bountiful harvests and abundant game, while the latter group is left to starve - plants mysteriously wither where they settle, and animals avoid their spears with unnatural foresight.</GameOverSoSNeutralBTribal>

  <GameOverSoSNeutralC>You request that {1} exterminate all neutral factions.</GameOverSoSNeutralC>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralCOutlander>{0} is completely unprepared for your sudden attack. Communication infrastructure is paralyzed, military hardware hacked, and the populace left defenseless against swarms of mosquito-sized drones which inject mechanites that stop their hearts. Within a week, only ruins and corpses are left of {0}.</GameOverSoSNeutralCOutlander>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralCOutlanderRough>Rather than directly attack {0}, {2} uses psychic projection to stir internal divisions, inflaming generals' ambitions even as the supreme leader is forced to make strategic mistakes. Within three days the government of {0} has completely collapsed, and survivors are easy prey for swarms of mechanoids under {2}'s control.</GameOverSoSNeutralCOutlanderRough>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralCTribal>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, telling them that they have been cursed for their actions. Plants mysteriously wither where the tribe settles, and animals avoid their spears with unnatural foresight. Despite their prayers for forgiveness, {0} soon starves.</GameOverSoSNeutralCTribal>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralCTribalRough>{2} psychically stirs divisions among the warriors of {0}. Small disagreements turn into violent action, and even the gentlest among them is soon taken by berseker fury. Within a week, the last tribesman cuts his brother's throat, and bleeds out himself soon after.</GameOverSoSNeutralCTribalRough>
  <GameOverSoSNeutralCEmpire>With their technological prowess and mighty fleet, {0} is the one local power which could potentially challenge {2}. The archotech unleashes every dirty trick at its disposal; psychically manipulating powerful individuals, releasing deadly pathogens into their ships' enclosed environments, and subjugating lesser AIs beneath its mighty mind. {2} also oversees the construction of a vast orbital shipyard which assembles dozens of battleships for a decisive final conflict. The war ends with {0} in ruins, though the victory is a costly one.</GameOverSoSNeutralCEmpire>
  <GameOverSoSEnemyA>Your enemies are given a choice: submit or die.</GameOverSoSEnemyA>
  <GameOverSoSEnemyAOutlander>The military of {0} launches a brave but futile attack, quickly succumbing to technologies beyond their understanding. The civilian government offers a grudging but unconditional surrender. Former citizens of {0} are rounded up to be sold as slaves, becoming a permanent underclass in {1}.</GameOverSoSEnemyAOutlander>
  <GameOverSoSEnemyAOutlanderRough>The military of {0} launches a brave but futile attack, quickly succumbing to technologies beyond their understanding. Since their government was largely run by the military, there is no organized surrender. Aside from small bands of refugees willing to accept a life in slavery, there are no survivors from {0}.</GameOverSoSEnemyAOutlanderRough>
  <GameOverSoSEnemyATribal>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, fulfilling their most beloved tribal prophecies and promising an age of plenty - under the condition that they surrender to their hated enemy, {1}. Most of the tribe condemns it as a vile trickster spirit. They are surprised when, in the coming weeks, plants mysteriously wither where they settle, and animals avoid their spears with unnatural foresight. Those few who avoid starvation surrender to {1}.</GameOverSoSEnemyATribal>
  <GameOverSoSEnemyATribalRough>{2} psychically manifests itself to the elders of {0}, bearing the severed heads of the tribe's pantheon of warrior gods. Enraged, the tribe makes plans to unleash its mightiest berserkers against this foreign god's followers - only to watch them slaughter their own people, psychically manipulated into an undirected frenzy. Survivors of the massacre submit to {1} and its mighty god.</GameOverSoSEnemyATribalRough>
  <GameOverSoSEnemyAEmpire>Although the shattered empire refuses your demand at first, an archotech's protection would give even their ancient enemies pause.

  <GameOverSoSEnemyB>You request that {1} exterminate your enemies.</GameOverSoSEnemyB>
  <GameOverSoSColonists>Your crew live lives of unimaginable luxury as the ruling class of a new glitterworld. Even the most bizarre requests take up an infinitesimal fraction of {0}'s processing power, and it gladly provides everything from great plasteel palaces to customized mates. You are made immortal by customized strains of mechanites, and yet should eternity prove boring, {0} offers to upgrade you into post-human intelligences yourselves.\n\nAny path you can imagine is now open to you. Your story is yours to write. You are:</GameOverSoSColonists>
